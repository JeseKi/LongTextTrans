{"message": true, "content": "one\nThe vanity of the family does not mean that it does not exist, and the principles you have summed up may not be useful in the future. A good business model or a good business is grown by yourself, not by you. Can the future be calculated? I can't figure it out. God is the word, Tao, Dharma, nature, the Tathagata, a real concept, people who know must know. When Sakya says emptiness, emptiness and nothingness, he does not mean that he does not exist. In my words, it is unstable, and everything is in a state of change. What you are sure is also changing, but what is one of the biggest problems for us human beings? I will choose to control what I am sure of. Once I control it, I will block it. Why? Because. Everything in the world is changing. The principles you summed up may not work in the future. What is our problem? That is, we do not know that this thing is changeable, and he insists on one thing, my past experience, my past all these things, but you still do not understand, what is the Tathagata talking about? Because you believe in and believe in things, you take data as certainty, take all kinds of things as certainty, it's no fun to play like this. You just lift a rock and shoot yourself in the foot. Vanity does not mean that it does not exist, but it exists, but everything in the world is changing, a good business model or a good business, it is grown by itself, not by you. Many of our founders are going to control it in the first place. I'm going to control this thing. You're wrong. KK wrote a book called out of control. What do you mean out of control is out of control? don't control it. If anyone can turn your business model into chaos and your business model into a state of self-organizing typing, you will lose it.\ntwo\nWhat can you do if you lose money on a business, right? Entrepreneurial losses dare to start a business, he must have many ways to make money, many have ways to make money, you and I take me as an example, first, if I go to start a business, I do not go to start a business, what can I do? First, I have a brand, second, I can make music, third, I can do three languages, these three points can fill me up, fourth, I can draw, fifth, I can be an interpreter, I can go to a big factory, I can do everything I have, but what is this? This is your barbell, that is, you have to put your eggs in each basket. I dare to start this business, because I know I can't starve to death, okay? You have to have multiple bars and zero thinking to turn yourself into this society, no matter how much it changes or suppresses you, you have to have such ability. This is the key point. I go to work in the company, I go, I act as an interpreter, although I, not to mention I translate documents, of course I can, ah, I may go to China on business, I go to the United States on business, wherever I go, I can go as long as I speak English. What's the point? I can still live, but I found my mission, I know. So what's my mission? So I went to do my mission, but you need multiple barbells to arrange your things, you have to have this kind of anti-vulnerability ability, that is, you are not vulnerable. I lost this thing, I have the next thing. In any case, I have a way out, but your premise is that after you have these ways of retreat and find a mission, I choose to cut off all the ways of retreat, and I will go in that direction. Even if I fail, what else can I do? I can come again, I can fail again, I can come again, I can come again, I have such confidence in myself.\nthree\nYou remember, entrepreneurship is not Nirvana rebirth, entrepreneurship is to discover value, I will point here, entrepreneurship is to discover the value contained in it, and how to enlarge this value. It is not for you to be reborn in Nirvana, discover this, discover the irrationality of the operation of this society, and solve this irrationality in time. Entrepreneurship is that you have a keen sense of smell, in time to find the irrationality in the market environment, as well as to solve the problem, this is entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is a process of subverting one paradigm, er, subverting another paradigm, or a new paradigm breaking the old paradigm. The key is that the composition of this paradigm is that you should first have an understanding of the immortal rules and have a sense of body. You need to know how to do something valuable. In addition, what is the value support, and how do you find this value support, instead of staying on the surface of the decadent model? Sometimes he even transcends life and death, which is the power of truth. You didn't find a lot of people, a lot of great scientists, he was very strange, some of his behavior was very strange, Feynman was very strange, Einstein was even weirder, he took the check sent to him by Princeton University as a bookmark, and then sent it to someone else. Ogilid is even weirder, Don Newton has never had sex in his life, and they have all fallen somewhere. That immortal study explores the existence of that immortal. Kant's own alarm clock, which is alive in his life, has little social intercourse. He goes out at a regular time every day and goes home regularly. They are all, they already exist with the immortal things, they finally exist together. So anyone they subjectively realize that the world, they all choose unnecessary, unnecessary, I have, I have found something I do not like, I stayed with them, Michelangelo, even more interesting, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci are very strange, I deleted Wechat to each other a long time ago, with them we Wechat deleted each other, we no longer contact Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Pythagoras, Newton and I all deleted Wechat from each other, but. Newton's cousin, I also know that the money is still very strong, so what are they all following? they are all following the immortal, discovering the immortal thing. Is there anything immortal in your business? where does the soul mission come from? The mission of the soul is to discover the immortal axiom and harness it in your own entrepreneurial system. Let that thing start to become something for you, become the premise of the logical immediate assumption of your business, and become the premise of your mission, let that thing become the premise of your mission, and then you have a sense of certainty. this sense of certainty is not brought to you by others, but by yourself.\nfour\nAh, when all people only see the results, most people have no future, because money does not gather with such people. I think you have to think before you do anything. If you do this thing without thinking, I don't think you can do it well. Your thoughts may not be recognized, and money is more intuitive. So everyone will roll, because any innovative enterprise, any one for human beings, or for human material transportation or technology, human spiritual civilization. Even innovation in the model, there must be a thinking, is in the money, what we see is money, but there is something behind it that you cannot see, you only see this result, er, when all people only see the result, because most people have no future, because money does not gather to such people and close to such people, money is at the point of unit energy. You need to be able to release enough energy at this point. Money is given a certain attribute, in my opinion, it is information, that is to say. What kind of information can you extract, what information is important, or what information we are going to go to in the next stage, or a direction to be achieved in the next stage, in this direction, you will extract several pieces of very refined and ultimately high-value information, and combine these high-value information into a new point. Many people may have thought of this thing, thought of this thing, but he did not take this thing very seriously, he may have thought of it occasionally, but he did not put this matter into action, so he put it down, or gave up, and then he turned to look for how to get money quickly, but did you find that money is mobile? You are not the owner of money, the central bank is, and the money you can earn is limited, because we are not a relative free market economy, your money depends on your line, or even your industry at any time. It's all possible, so do you think that if you don't do it enough, how can it be long-term? Then how can this thing be stable? So when I do anything, my personal style is to think first, to be a thinker, and then to carry out this thing. Thinking is to do bottom inference or bottom deduction for this thing. I think this step is very important, because if I don't think about it, if I just go to do such a thing, there is a cycle in the market, that is, a lot of people make a lot of money, either investment banking, insurance, or risk. Venture capital, ah, all kinds of funds, etc., I think they are also looking for a problem that can be sure of the future and really talk about, is enough. On this, this, on this, he sees the nature of the problem in the system, and then he chooses to use a unique way of thinking to make the problem irrelevant, and then turn this thing into a new industry. Or a new technology. After completing a new paradigm shift, I think those investment banks invest their money in you, or venture capital invests their money in you. I think this is the nature of money, or the nature of doing business or starting a business. So a very good entrepreneur, he 1SENIOR entrepreneur will be a continuous entrepreneur, he must be an idea first, and then an executor. This is my personal idea, which may not be right, but this is my personal idea. I like to think a lot of questions, to think, to dig a lot of problems, but many of our netizens will think that seeing is believing, seeing is believing. But you, what you have to do is ignore them. One way not to take advantage of is to be an idealist, remember that idealists are not people without logic, idealists are not people who do not think deeply, let's split them up, idealists, he must first have a reason, the truth of all things is in front, and then he begins to think, because reason, mathematical logic, line logic, it is all reason in front, it has an axiom in front, basis. Start thinking from a reasonable point of view, this is my analysis of idealists, ah, as an idealist, I think it is a very good thing, maybe others will think you are crazy, or others will think that your ideas are impractical, because they see a lot, and most people see results, and they pay attention to results, because our nation pays so much attention to results. But an idealist, when he thinks about a problem, he must be right beforehand, through this reason, this axiom, and then I begin to think about the problem, this is idealism, but when the idealist takes his first step, he must be misunderstood. You must be prepared to be misunderstood. I think many scientific and technological innovations are actually misunderstood. We don't know what we are doing. Think he is crazy, think he is an impractical person, but I think I, I want to be such a person, very good.\nWe all said just now that we have made the right choice. We have just said that we have seen what this business environment is like, what is the business environment in China, or the business environment of the whole world, or that of mankind as a whole, then what should we do? How can we take a road that no one has ever taken before? College students have this closed system for college students, the market has a closed system for the market, and every industry has a closed system for each industry. most of the way of thinking is to look for content within the system, that is, within the framework, and this"}{"message": true, "content": "What do you mean, the only thought? Jump out and find the problem, jump out and look at the problem outside the system, and you'll enter a larger system, which is better than rolling it up with the big guys in the original system, right? That is, the only way of thinking is to see a problem in this system, jump out with a question, or when you ask this question, you have already, you have already come out of the system, because this problem does not exist only in this system, if this question is the only question worth asking, then some you think about this question, or to some extent, It shocked you from the soul level. For example, we used the small experiment that I sent and forwarded to determine the existence of this problem in the experiment, didn't we? We all said just now that we made the right choice. We all said just now that we have seen what this business environment is like, what is the business environment of China, or the business environment of the whole world, or that of mankind as a whole. What should we do? how can we take a road that no one has ever taken before? Isn't that right? In fact, Douyin is a system, China is a system, the United States is a system, Japan is a system, Spain is a system, Germany is also a system. How to jump out of the system and look at the problem? So we have to ask a few questions, what is the ultimate question? What is the ultimate problem in the system? The ultimate in your business, your industry? What's the problem? I suggest you write it down and find the ultimate problem first. How to find the ultimate problem is to find the bug of the system. The second step is how to ask the ultimate question. When I broadcast live, I will often ask this person a lot of questions, just because of what, how do you feel, why do you feel, and I will keep asking the other person until he has lost his hair. Is this feeling right? Unlimited follow-up, first find the ultimate question, and then follow-up, this is a means to explore the essence of the bug of this question, ah, unlimited follow-up. We are going to think about another question, the environment in which the problem exists and the specific space in which the problem exists. Is this question based on seeing for believing or seeing for nothing? The cause of your problem is that what you see is what you believe, or is it that you didn't think of it at all? You just think it's a problem, it's a problem, okay? Your question you followed up to the ultimate question, well, I now think this is a problem, and now we are going to discuss it, that is, the current environment in which your problem occurs. Is he the essence of the problem? Is it caused by the surface rheology you see? Or is it that this problem is not a problem at all, but you regard the prerequisite, what you see is believing, as the major premise of this problem? But if what you see is not true, is this still a problem? This is what Musk said, the first step is not to put forward stupid requirements, the second step is not to optimize the problems or content that should not exist, we have what is the ultimate question, and then how to ask the ultimate question? and then seeing is believing or seeing is believing. The next step is to sum up what is the difference between induction and deduction? Induction and deduction have been explained before, so there is no need to explain them here. With this idea, after this thinking, and then you think about, what is the world, who am I? What is the thinking of this phenomenal world? you can ask it again, isn't this kind of thinking fun? is it particularly fun?\nsix\nMost of them just buy your product, and then it's gone, there's no more, sell the product, make money, and then we over, we can do it, and I don't think what am I going to do after I can sell the product? So what kind of user experience will be improved next? Or what new products do I have to make? It's not that I just make money and it's over. Many people think so, so how do you grow up? Entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs are a sacred and inviolable profession. I am talking about real entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs. They see two contradictory opposites. What most people can see is binary opposition. Ordinary people can only stand in binary opposition, either right, or wrong, or good, or bad, or bad, or evil, but entrepreneurs do not see things in this way. After seeing this binary opposition thinking, he went to find out what the two of them had in common, that is, to look at the problem after jumping out of the binary opposition, what did they have in common? do you think it's expensive on this side or on the other side? You sell expensive, and then I can't find the good stuff. I'm going to step on the good stuff. What the entrepreneur wants to solve is the contradiction between these two species, or between the two species. How should I do it in what way? my idea is here, and then I see a world like this, this is my idea, and then I see the world. I drew a world like this, and then next to me, even through this idea, what am I going to find? I want to find out what is innovation and growth, and then what is here, here is the ultimate feedback from users, under this new business model, the idea world comes back, and then comes back to this idea world, to form an isomorphism, to form an isomorphism, if there is no such isomorphism, then it's over, most of us just buy your goods, and then there's no more. Sell the product, make money, and then we over, we can, and I don't think I can sell the product, what am I going to do next? So what kind of user experience will be improved next? Or what new products do I have to make? It's not that I just make money and it's over. Many people think so, so how do you grow up, right? it's not. Fight for welfare and life, but your enterprise continues to innovate the boundary, the ability to break through the boundary, and then you will have a new idea world born again, and then the new idea world will sink again, your circle will draw bigger and bigger, sink again, draw again, draw again, spell Tao, not art, not man-made things, but potential in reason. The cornerstone hypothesis requires critical thinking.\nseven\nAs a human being, when we come to this world, everyone is fair. I just don't think it is fair. What is unfair? The universe of desire is a kind person, and the universe has its own rules. What is the compassion we always talk about? Or what is the heart of sharing? Everyone is fair, and this is the compassion of the universe. The earth is always sharing its resources with us, but when it asks us, it asks us for nothing, because the ball or even the universe knows that this is the rule, and it never asks us for anything, but we ask for it from the earth. The same is true of people, we never think about what we give, and we always think about taking, or there will be something in return after I give. If I have the ability to pay, then I will give. I have nothing to get back. No. The universe is fair, and so are human beings. Why don't you just say what the earth asked you for? He didn't ask you for anything. It's the same with starting a business. Do it. The things that are really valuable, the things that create value for society, what you want, the energy is fair, equal, and the same. You really create value for people and society, not for your own self-interest. I believe that more and more people will agree with you, you help them to solve this problem, everyone lives happily, then naturally you will be happy, won't you?\neight\nEinstein once said that the purpose of education is to make this person. In the end, we can ask a good question. Jewish education is like this. We don't even have this concept in mind. How to judge that is the best problem? we have found a common problem, but we all think that this is the right thing to do. But what I think. This is wrong, or whether this problem is a real problem, or what is the first driving force of this problem, what is the formation of this problem, I will first find the inconsistent problem, or the logical disharmony in its system structure, and then start with that problem and keep digging deeper and deeper. I have an insight into the solution of WEB3. I am completely because of a very simple question, where can I find a factory? It's just that when I go to the factory, where can I find someone I can trust to make the version of this dress? So simple two questions, and then I slowly found that their link is wrong and their mode of operation is not right, the combination between people is also wrong, the way to find people is also wrong. The relationship between supply and demand is also wrong, so what is right after all? Then I have to go backwards, what is the human relations of production from the ape period? Is it true that only a certain group of apes can do such a thing? But this ability is inborn, so what are these people I see on these sites doing? Why were they seen? What will they be seen for? What kind of combination do you see? How did this model come into being? Is it correct? Does this form a barrier and a closed loop? So the ultimate question for all of these people is how the information is combined. How are the elements finally combined? How should they be combined? how should they be combined? This is the way I think about this, because in the final analysis, it is all about the combination of combination and information units. How do you think about the ultimate problem, and then you can think about how even the stars are combined, how the Milky way is combined, how the natural environments in nature are combined, and how people are combined? How are animals combined? How is the gene DNA combined? how are the genes combined? How do people reproduce? How are aquatic plants, sheep, lions and bacteria, including scavengers and rivers, combined? What is the end of the barren leaves? What is its final form? This is how I think, this is the way I ask questions, but everyone has a different way, but this is the way I think. If you ask me what is the ultimate question, the deeper you ask, the more ambitious you are, and you can't control it. When you find the solution to that ultimate problem, what about your heart, the beating frequency, bang? You said that you would suddenly find yourself like this, but I don't know what other people are like. You can't just look at business, this thing has gone beyond business, it has risen to the level of philosophy or theology, but that's enough, it's enough to be a business.\nnine\nThe most powerful thing about a founder is the ability to abstract. As for the specific implementation of the people, you let those professionals to do what I am good at, my strong board is to build architectural thinking. This is what I am good at, so what I am looking for next is someone who is suitable or good at helping me solve the things I want to build. In theory, whose money I am looking for, where is this person, and how to find it? I can find what kind of person I need, where this person is, and what kind of person I am looking for. But you need an architect's mind. I find it more and more important to know something. Please, if you can understand this, I believe. Um, so you know the Athenian school in ancient Greece, why didn't they do those useful things? what they thought was useful, useful work, that is to say, to do this thing, it was practical, he didn't do anything useful. He won't even do it. Those were done by craftsmen.\nten\nDoing business is actually philosophy in the end, doing it is philosophy in the end. You will find everything, any marketing tools you use to do business, team management, financial management, and then about this."}{"message": true, "content": "The choice of a major direction is philosophy in the end. Because you will find that all the things you are limited to the surface of the flow, it is decadent things can not be retained, you follow the so-called trend, all things are changing. In the end, you have to find one thing, that is, what is the thing that does not change or does not change? That means you have to find out what is the essence in the end? Because everything is changeable, philosophy studies the thinking itself, and what the thinking itself does not change. What is the nature of this thing? How to communicate, how to know formal logic, what is dialectical logic, where and what is wrong in dialectical logic, what is wrong in formal logic, right? You all need to understand this formal logic. sometimes you study the form and form of this thing, and there are also changes in the form and form. The dialectical logic itself is changeable. In the process of dialectical change, you are looking for something that does not change.\neleven\nIf I have no resources, I have no connections, I have no money, how can I fight against the giants? What I give you is a methodology, which is better than better. Any system has its underlying logic, it is bound to have its underlying logic to adapt to the establishment of a specific user group. If I want to start a business, how can I be better than better? Then if I want to be different, I have to burst his bubble, because if I don't burst his bubble, I will never be able to compete with him in volume, I will never be able to compete with him in resources, and I will never be able to compete with him in relationship. I can only make it collapse instantly by puncturing its underlying logic. Another is to find your own niche. You must find your own niche. I raise fish, right? Some fish live at the top, some live in the middle, some fish live at the bottom, you are a middle fish, you can't fight for food with the people below, you are an upper fish, you are wrong with the bottom. Then you messed up Barron in that market. Any kind of creature in nature has its own niche, find its own niche, and then you know where you want to live. You can compete with others in the wrong position. To do it is to burn money, right? misplaced competition staggered.\ntwelve\nDo you understand the enlightenment and awakening? Is there such a person? The family said that all things are bitter. He said that if a person wants to really become a Buddha, or whatever, he needs to help sentient beings to be liberated. What do you think sentient beings are? City utensils are sentient beings. What am I going to free him from? In fact, you really understand, you will feel that we actually have nothing to explain to him, give him relief, he is just an existence, when I understand all things, you and I free him, how can I be liberated? I took it apart, didn't I? He is still him, but it only means that you know that one day the remote control will be broken, and one day the remote control will run out of power. I see. But I have no way to liberate him, or to say that everything in this person has the Buddha nature, did he also say that the state of true enlightenment? no, that state is just that you understand, you know the Tathagata, as it is. And how do you become unpersistent, or because you understand the laws of everything in the world, he insists on this remote control. It is plastic, and there are screws under it, it is very tight, but one day it may fall to the ground and break. I know the structure of it, and I also know what it is. I wish it had this thing. Then he has become a Buddha, and he is not persistent, then why do I insist on him, including you as an entrepreneur? if you want to be an enterprise, your greatest help is not to accumulate wealth, but to create value for this society. Creating value is like giving, the problems of the past, all kinds of unreasonable problems in business in the past, you have seen it. Then turn this way of solving the problem into a way of breakthrough, innovation, subversion, and then help those who should have been helped. Altruism is giving, right? that is, you put what you have in mind. The poor can give and the rich can give. Is that right? The poor may say that I am willing to share my extra physical strength, or that I am willing to share, that is, I am going to help, or that I can't help you intellectually, but I can't help you physically, or you, how can you help me? you need me. I'll be here any time, right? Those who may have some knowledge are willing to give what is in my head. Share it. I share what's on my mind with me. To share this process, how can you, how can you be sure that you have no purpose, no utilitarianism to share this thing, then you want, then you say that this purpose is not to be photographed, if you make a picture of yourself, then why should you and I distribute this knowledge for free? I have to collect money. When you take a picture, if no one buys your things and no one buys your lessons, then you will be sad again. Don't stubbornly share what you think you can spread out. This is how you become a Buddha, whether it is right, you are a, you are a Buddha. Whether it's right, it's as simple as that, you are equal to the dissipative structure in physics, that is, I have increased entropy, I have too much knowledge, no, I can't hold it, I have to dissipate it, because I don't know who's in front of the screen, maybe he's starting his own business now, he may hear what I'm saying, he may understand the misthinking and create such an opportunity for him. Create a different way and an angle for him to open up a new world and see it. Won't you become a Buddha? Right, no picture, and then share, and then share. Don't refuse you, I only share with good-looking people, or I only share with people who can be enlightened, or I just share with people with high IQ, or I just share what I share with, don't take pictures, no matter how you look, I can also be willing to share with you. Because we do not know this person, people are all equal, equal to the same amount equal to each other, this is the story. Besides, this knowledge should not be charged. In my opinion, it is why you raise the moon too much and why you do such a thing. I don't want to collect money from this. This is the first one. Second, I think you can learn knowledge anywhere. It's just that you haven't found out how to learn it, or you don't know how to learn it. Then tell you how to learn it. Isn't that all right? That's it, right? at first, the little animals will chase you. Joke, joke, but if you want to do this, it is. Then just do it this way, no, don't be too photogenic, otherwise you will care about gain and loss. Why didn't I repay me when I did this? why should I give it to you for free? I said how I am, no. You don't understand the King Kong Sutra. Or you don't understand what the Buddha said. He went to my place to consult again, very leisurely to do, enjoy life, very calmly do such a thing. Just do it.\nthirteen\nReal entrepreneurship, in my opinion, as Zhang Lei said, it doesn't matter how much money you earn now, it doesn't matter how you make money now, your only moat is crazy value creation, it's your only moat. So how can we create value crazily? Only by giving them back what originally belongs to them can they create value crazily. With their own things, private property, sacrosanct, they can frantically create value, not me. I only provide water and oxygen so that animals on the prairie can reproduce, and it is their job to create life, not mine.\nfourteen\nMoney is just information. The money you borrowed from me is a debt. I will borrow money from the bank with many times the amount owed, and then I will have the money again. Then I will lend it to you again, and then you will lend it to you again. Then my capital will be more and more. Like a snowball, it will eventually get bigger and bigger. I lent you ten yuan, and then, although I lent you ten yuan, you will have to pay me back in the future, right? Isn't that right? then, now that I have the ten yuan you owe me, I will go to the bank to make a loan. I can make a loan at the bank. Because my enterprise has credibility, I can borrow ten times. For example, if I can borrow ten times, then I have 100yuan. Then I will lend out another 100yuan, and then I will have 1000 yuan. What is this thing over and over again? Anyi Financial Services, or this kind of platform similar to a loan, what is it selling, that is, how much energy can be released from my node, how much energy I can release, the more energy I release, the more information comes to me, the more information comes to me, the greater the energy, the only two things, information and energy, are in this simple universe. Well, the borrower thinks about the interest, ah, the interest looks like a hair on Jiuniu. Ant Financial Services Group is a man from the village. When it comes to spending and borrowing, these are all players, gamblers. Ant Financial Services Group is a banker. With money rolling, he can make other investments, right? he can still play with this thing in the same way, that is, the problem, the relationship between energy and information.\nfifteen\nWhat do you think of making money in the future? Now some physical industries or so-called traditional industries must face transformation, must be area transformation, in my opinion, how to transform? We must combine and upgrade with the third-generation Internet, because now there is less and less novelty in the traditional industry, and the things we do and the models and channels we all do are similar, that is, who sells more cheaply, or who can create some so-called gimmick. It's not interesting anymore. I think it's hard to get a piece of the pie or a piece of the cake. Because you are innovating again, in this era of fast consumption, I think if you dig deeply in the traditional industry, unless you do it very early, such as an enterprise like Wa, I can understand that it is only the kind of daily necessities that have been ploughed deeply for many years, and then they are ordinary daily necessities in people's lives. I think they can survive, but this kind of product, it has become this kind of commodity. In my opinion, it is like a kind of material for daily use, that is, everyone can't lack it, but it can't be sold that expensively. For example, a commodity may have a low net profit, and it may earn less than 20% of the money. But it can't help but measure a lot. This kind of thing may be faced with daily necessities, if you re-enter it at this time. If you enter this industry, I don't think you can compete with them. It's not interesting. I think in the future money-making industry, you can only embrace the third-generation Internet, because this is the biggest opportunity now. You don't have to make the third-generation Internet, but what you have to know is how to integrate your business into the third-generation Internet. How to integrate, how to upgrade, how to play, how to use new ways to put the old industry into new wine.\nsixteen\nThis gpt, ah, in fact, it does not affect any industry, it affects people's thinking, is he teaching you to be a human being again? if you don't want to be replaced by him, you have to think, what is the meaning of our existence? What is the significance of distinguishing people from artificial intelligence? Who am I? After he teaches you to be a man again, if you can't beat him, you have to follow his model. If you understand what a person is, you can completely break away from artificial intelligence, because you are a human being, you are you, not artificial intelligence, not a product of frame mode. So WEB3 and artificial intelligence are two races that can very much change the entire economic environment. Artificial intelligence teaches you how to be a human being, B3 provides you with a way to be a human being, and WEB3 provides you with the opportunity to turn over a new leaf and turn over a new leaf. This is normal."}{"message": true, "content": "Artificial intelligence is if, if you only rely on me, I will replace a lot of work, replace a lot of mental work logic, do you have any other PT logic? Your knowledge reserve has its own GP, okay? Your job can't be replaced completely by its GP. Yes, well, once you know who you are, then artificial intelligence will completely assist your role, and it will no longer replace you, but assist you, and it will become a technology called mirror topia that feels human and artificial intelligence in Lord KK's out of control.\nseventeen\nI appreciate your thinking very much, and I also want to learn your thinking, so what do I need to do, for example, um, if I want to learn these things through some books, or some videos, or these, that is, where did you learn these things, and then integrated into yourself, I like the study of chemistry, that is, I won't go to any business school classes, because I don't think those things are meaningful to me. Because what he has said is what he already has. I would be more inclined to read those classics, let the classics of the discipline, this is a book that I think is very awesome, I hope you can read the first European geometry, you may not have anything to do with business at first, right? That is, what you learned in junior high school is all in European geometry, and then there is the origin of species, to study quantum mechanics and a brief history of mankind, then these four are almost all books, right, these classics? because we seem to have nothing to do with business, but in fact not all of our commerce, you break it into the smallest unit of all these things, uh-huh. But I'm sure I don't have your savvy, not necessarily. I used to be a fool, a complete idiot, and I was able to pretend that everyone was wrong, and that's how I got here. So I...\neighteen\nWhat do you think is the nature of business? Or what is the underlying logic of business? There are two things that I think we have to think about. The first enterprise has to learn how to counter entropy increase, and the second is Darwin's origin of species, that is, the theory of evolution or evolution. I say that this law of entropy increase is actually the rule of the universe. In fact, it does not only work on commerce. The whole nature, including human society, is like this, um, more essential law. Why is the core of business anti-entropy increase? If you know the concept of the law of entropy increase, it will continue to increase in a closed system, if there is no external energy intake, the same is true for a company, if the organization of a company is too redundant, or if the organization of a company is too bloated, it will cause a very unnecessary increase, where does this entropy increase come from? This entropy increase may come from your mission, the vision of your values, or the whole system of your company that you already make money. On top of the system that has already made money, you will think that you can just lie flat and harvest directly. But this is not the case, because you are not aware of a problem. There is a hand called Entropy Entropy, which may come and grab you by the neck at any time. Therefore, we must have this mindset, so I say that the increase of anti-entropy is always the cause of the enterprise. then how do you talk about the origin of the species of the second Darwin from this level? Tell me.\nnineteen\nI regard every business as a species, and every enterprise as a species, because every species naturally has its birth. Er, this set of complex systems or complex science, it starts from a chaotic state, then to this aggregation state, then from aggregation, finally to emergence, to emergence, finally to this metabolism, and then to the final, um, overall stage, it's all such a process, and any company has come through this way. So what we should always be wary of is what Darwin said, that is, variation plus selection equals evolution. So if all companies we do not focus on their own variation, if we do not focus on choosing their own niche in the whole business, then we will stand with the giants, at this time our ecology, where is our own niche? This also includes where our mutations are, and where are we different from other companies? It is better to be different than better. I think this sentence is also the most important, that is, how do you play in the process of continuous innovation and variation. Where is the misplaced competition between me and the giant? I can't stand up to the tycoon, am I right? I am a small drama, and the same tycoon also has its own dangers, that is, once this species is formed, it will have its own advantages, but when it has its own advantages, just like elephants are afraid of mice, they will certainly have what they think is certain, but this certainty is also a point that small businesses can cut into, such as a recent example, that is, Google's largest search engine in the world. But why did a little lower GBT let it set off the red alert? This is called mutation, found its own niche. All of this evolved species, it tends to the blind end of the lateral limb, because when every creature has a bottleneck in its evolution, it has a collateral blind end, that is, it pinches it off, and without this piece, it stops evolving, or it is slow, so it gives opportunities to small businesses and marginal enterprises, because big companies will never realize what kind of new thing will subvert it. Because its mission and values are too fixed, the variation plus selection and isolation mentioned by Darwin should form reproductive isolation from the original enterprise. Is to evolve into two kinds. Completely different species, GPD and Google have formed a complete reproductive isolation, the two of them can not be integrated, and Google is so large, it is impossible to integrate with other GBD, he will never agree to this, because of its mission vision and values. So I say these two points, a law of entropy increase and Darwinian evolution. I think this is the point that we have to think about.\ntwenty\nWell, in addition to savvy, do you, ah, have this kind of rather tragic experience, and then you may force you to understand these things, and then combine practice with theory, and then get something in your brain now. I remember that it was when I first started my business, on the 23rd and 24th, that I was very naive, or very stupid, during the 23rd and 24th of the day. My idea at that time was actually very simple. At the beginning, I wanted to do a relatively large sushi restaurant in China. This was a Japanese restaurant. This was my first idea, because I thought I could do this thing. Because at that time, I was still compared. At that time, I was also slightly involved in the entertainment industry. What I thought was, um, I know so many stars. Or if I knew so many people, I could have done this thing at that time, right? and I also knew about this. Then, because I was still young at that time, I didn't think about the specific business model or anything. I did it directly. Later, it was because the capital chain was broken, but the gold chain was not a human factor, it was because of this objective factor. At that time, I probably thought that if I had the first venture capital, it would be, er, about 4 million to 5 million. At that time, when I was 23 years old, when the capital chain was broken, I suddenly felt that it was really painful at that time. Ah, that's why I just put my eggs in a basket, and when I think about it, I think it's true that I'm going to do this. Have I made up my mind? Or do I really know that I am supposed to do such a thing? am I fit to do such a thing? And still, I was just trying to make money, and as soon as this thing failed, I thought, ah, it turned out that I was just trying to make money, and I didn't figure it out at that time. Did I suffer for a long time later? But in fact, it is nobody's fault in this matter.\ntwenty-one\nSometimes an industry may not be very good, but by drawing big cakes to make this bubble blow up quickly, you look at Magellan, look at Columbus, can the sun draw big cakes? I'm super, I'm super, people like us make a list first, brag once, and then finish it in turn. Make a list and brag, this is our style of doing things, you are very real, that is, that 3.0 will be earth-shaking different, earth-shaking different? I believe that outside 3."}{"message": true, "content": "01 will definitely be earth-shaking and produce earth-shaking changes. Moreover, everyone can make money. This is my bragging. I want to realize this bragging. I will bring a group of people to realize this bragging. Everyone will become useful. I will first brag about this bragging, and then practice it. I will brazenly brag about it, and then realize this bragging for a few years. I can't guarantee that I can contact others. We will be around five years.\n22\nYou look at all the bloggers on the chatter, including the knowledge paid book, all the knowledge he just gives you a fruit first, didn't you find out? He doesn't pay as much attention as I do, because they all give you fruit first, they grasp the shortcomings of human nature, the bugs in the thinking of the human brain, as long as you watch my video, you can do what you want. What will be taught in my next course? He will give you a fruit first, because what you pay attention to is the fruit. You don't know, because, because we all like the fruit. When you like the fruit, you will pay for this class. However, what kind of things this class can bring you is unknown. It is his transaction that has been completed. Otherwise, you would have started early, right? I can't do it, I pay late, I can't do it, I can't, I still don't have the ability to spend big cakes. The sun said, do not regard fans as users, you are not users, you are ancestors, all ancestors, fans 'ancestors' sales structure, financing, investment and financing funds, a very cattle, a very powerful sales is to paint cakes, a very powerful knowledge blogger is also to paint cakes, knowledge payment is to paint cakes are all.\n23\nWhat is the number of flying money in the 32nd season of Guiguzi? If you want to go fishing, you first have to make a fish pond. How to make this fish pond? This fish pond must be big enough. Find a fish pond big enough. For example, what things do we need? What things can arouse everyone's fear? What things can arouse everyone's thinking about the future? What things are everyone yearning for? Fish ponds to hook up, followed by nest, then bait and hook. What is the biggest fish pond? The biggest fish pond with chatter is chatter itself. We are no longer saying that there are any business opportunities in chatter. chatter is a business opportunity. If you specifically analyze what business opportunities there are in chatter, you can say a lot, but chatter has been subconsciously thought by everyone that chatter is a business opportunity. Many people don't think about it, so chatter is a business opportunity. Even if he thinks he is himself, so what did I just say? If you cheat him, it's better to let him cheat himself. Let him fool himself. I just created it. It's just the architecture. I created such an ecosystem architecture as chatter, and then let him think that chatter is on the plane, let him think that bringing goods is a business opportunity, let him think that Short Video are on the plane, let him deceive himself, you don't have to do anything, you just need to construct such a set, you just need to have a fish pond, let him deceive himself, hey, let him earn some money, you don't let him earn more, just like you can't hang bait on a fishhook. A hook can only hang a bait bar, you give him a bait is enough, hang a corn grain, this only a few catties or even more than ten catties of carp, it can hook, you go to deceive him useless, let him deceive himself. Therefore, the ability to draw cakes is very important, that is, your ability to make fish ponds is very important. Believe in the sun, the sun does not set up a routine. If I wanted to set up a routine with you, I would have set up a routine long ago. With my ability, I can. I have been holding this temperament for so many years.\n24\nThese entrepreneurs and future entrepreneurs after 1990, 1995, 1990 and even 1990 must achieve one point, that is, extreme accumulation, philosophical thinking, and must be cognitive entrepreneurs rather than empirical entrepreneurs. By copying, by plagiarism, by copying, not if you want to prevent the West from sticking to the mold, you must have philosophical thinking, because all your technologies, if you only rely on plagiarism and imitation, don't they all come from you saying that you will stick to your neck? They must be powerful cognitive entrepreneurs. Only in this way can you question whether those businesses that exist in the market necessarily exist or whether their existence is reasonable. Because this kind of thinking can create innovative soil. The sun thinks Ma Zhegou after all, this is the problem that entrepreneurs should think about, don't be limited to a certain academic, open it.\n25\nThere is nothing wrong with the development of capital; the problem lies with man, not with capital. If capital can effectively drive social innovation, then the appreciation of capital is not a good thing. Only with capital can he innovate. Only with capital can he develop new products and technologies. But what many people see is money. They don't see how money comes from or where it should be. Many of us just look at money, not what money can create or what new technology can create to lead human society in what direction. We can't see it. We just sell fake goods, make fake wine, sell fake food, fake all kinds of meat, synthetic meat, all kinds of things. This is the problem. Capital itself is not wrong, nor is it that entrepreneurs, er, break the rules of this society or anything. It is not that they are creating a new employment environment. They are creating new technology. In fact, we have not thought through it. We are talking about those unscrupulous businessmen who buy and sell things and sell things. They do not create any value. Just like Buffett, what value Buffett has created and what value Buffett has not created, he just invests money. Uh, but he is an investment expert, ah, but I don't care if he is an investment expert. I only see what value he has created for this society. If he can get mutton under the condition of feeding grass to sheep and sheep growing faster, then I think this person can create any value. Besides, what he does is not for grass or sheep. What he does is for money. It is just a game of money. I think he does not create value. He does not give human society any development other than forward development. He didn't do such a thing. I didn't say that money is right, but if everyone pursues this thing in the whole environment, there will definitely be problems, there will definitely be problems. Moreover, this problem, ah, sometimes in your life inadvertently, it will monopolize any point in your life. By the time you discover it, it will be too late. Sometimes it is like cancer. At the beginning, you didn't discover what it is. When you really discover it, He was already extremely hungry, and he was already suffering from an incurable disease.\n26\nNot ideological entrepreneurs, but cognitive entrepreneurs, we have moved from the material war, what is the material war? How much money do you have, how many connections do you have, has already transitioned from the war of matter to the war of laws. I can do this not because I have many resources, I can do this not because I have many relationships, I can do this not because I have many endorsements. This thing certainly does not exist completely, but it has already transitioned from a war of matter to a war of laws. What's a war of laws? It is very important to start a business completely on the basis of first principles. The battle of laws is not the battle of matter. We are not fighting who. What if you can quickly occupy the market? I am ours. It is the underlying logic of human beings. What is the underlying logic of the whole business? Even in the entire natural world, in the entire human race, in the entire universe, what are the operating rules of matter? Spelling is this, this is the most important, otherwise how can today's GPT defeat Google, right? What is its gpt? Why do I say that China cannot do it, other GPTs simply cannot do it? It is not that the technology is not good. Instead, the essence of information is not good or bad. The next GP needs distributed algorithms to continuously integrate, continuously iterate and calculate. What he wants is information. The essence of information is not good or bad. Information must be relatively open and diversified. Or relative to fair information, information talents may learn and calculate. If the source of information is insufficient, the source of information is opaque, and the source of information is not that or something, Then you can't make the next body, impossible, this is not a technical problem in the future, robot artificial intelligence he does not consider the quality of this information? Therefore, the robot has no morality, just like that fast hand who just got up to speed skating at the beginning. When he was rectified at the beginning, the fast hand was not because, because in speed skating, the fast hand was an information distribution platform, or a platform for Short Video, and then Zhang Yiming was included. At the beginning, today's headline was also Zhang Yiming and Suhua were rectified. The principle of the two of them was that the technology itself did not make sense, but the information was not good or bad. However, they were later ordered to be removed from the shelves for rectification, and then they felt that because of such restrictions, it was impossible for you to have a GPT in your country. It was impossible for you to invest money again and burn money for nothing. It's only possible to make children with Down syndrome, but I'm telling you, innovation doesn't come from that kind of place, absolutely not. Or that Socrates said, your words are not enough, after all, your information is not enough, after all, questioning the information is likely to give birth to innovation, questioning the information is not likely to give birth to innovation. Entrepreneurs are like this. Entrepreneurs question each other's, question each other's business logic self-consistency. You question something that needs to be questioned. Do you need to question it? There are many cultures in the world, you only know one culture, and then you only question this culture, is it useful? No, how do you innovate, how do you start a business, how do you do something different?\n27\nWhat is the difference between people? I think there is actually no gap between people. No, it's just what he is suitable for. It's just to see what kind of talents this society needs. If you don't have the doubts about the way talents are screened, you can only live in this circle and can't get out. Just like you are a fish weighing 20 jin, he wants to catch a fish weighing 100 jin, its mesh is big, and then you will not be caught, you think you are useless, not all processes, you have to question this salt rule, question it 2000 years ago Wuzilide's geometric original has said very clearly, Things are equal to each other which is equal to each other, equal to the same amount. The common formula of 2000 years ago is still Euclid's Euclidean geometry today. What is one of the most important points you remember about systematic thinking? It is not to replace the elements within the system, but the connection between the elements. The elements themselves are elements, hydrogen atoms are hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms are oxygen atoms, just the connection between hydrogen and oxygen. Today, we have cultivated everyone into hydrogen atoms, all of which are hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atom and. It is not a single element, what quality it is or what bottom it is, but the combination of different elements is the most important, so that you can have systematic thinking. People don't need to change, as long as they become themselves, but in the process of becoming themselves, do we have such a mechanism to make him better become himself? This is a question for entrepreneurs to think about. Let me repeat, ah, it is possible that what I said is all wrong. You should question the way I said it. Don't think what I said is right. I may also be limited to my own cognitive scope. Sun, this kind of thinking needs to be supported by many other original laws. Right, I just have many other original laws to support it, so I can say this sentence, otherwise there is no logic. Xinjiang people, do I look like Xinjiang people? I, you bring me that speaker, talk, talk.\n28\nIs gossip a stock? You can try, you can try, then entrepreneurs like us, we don't have to write BP, we directly hand over the characters to investors, will you read my gossip, you won't read my characters, you won't read the characters, you are not qualified to vote, what business model do you need? Who do you cover? I'll tell you Bayesian formula. The premise of Bayesian formula is that you must give him a premise. What do you bring in? Bring in a number. But the problem is that if you stick to Bayes formula that probability distribution, you're missing out. That's not the point. What's the point? The key is how the Bayes formula inside Bayes formula is possible, even the number that underpins Bayes formula, or the smallest element, the initial element.\n29\nThe awesome businessman only does the first element. He doesn't look at the probability. He never looks at it, because just like the quantum double-slit interference experiment, I don't look at whether this particle is a wave function or a particle. I don't look at whether it is a wave function on which he finally puts it. I rely on Bayes formula. How do I calculate its probability? It's just like gambling. The person of the ox is that I only do that light, observe, as for the observer, no matter where you observe, whether you observe from the front or from the back of both sides, your observation is only an image of it. and the most powerful thing is that at the beginning, the light emitted is the most important thing. If your business model can become light itself, instead of looking at the Bayesian formula to calculate the probability, then you are a very good person, and we are all looking at probability now. We're all looking at wow chatter now, looking at data, looking at nonsense. If you want to become light itself, or the smallest single element, you look at the K line, look at the chicken feather, or the same sentence, if you look at this, you have your arrangements, the world has other arrangements, you can't arrange anything, because you are still in one of his systems, you look at problems within the system, you always only see problems within the system, you can't jump out, just like you look at the I Ching in the I Ching, then it is always right. You closed the logic loop yourself, and you reconciled yourself.\n30\nNo matter what kind of education you have, or what kind of position you are in, in fact, we have to say that we all live in Newton's mechanical world view. After the Second Industrial Revolution, the organizational structure of the whole company, including all companies now, is Newton's mechanical theory layer after layer. This has led to the fact that if our personnel can be replaced, our education method is also in line with the Second Industrial Revolution. What we produce is basically parts. Then parts with the same parts represent the same parts that can be replaced, parts represent that you are not unique, and you do not have scarcity. Newton's mechanical theory of society, everyone lives like a machine, what major do you learn, especially engineering students, science students, what do you learn? Will your major have a job in the future? Not necessarily, this is just a false promise given to you by the school or society. Can you really find a job? No, it is not true. So Newton's mechanical world, I might say Newton's horn also destroyed management. Any closed mechanical system will produce entropy increase. Any company, when it reaches this machine limit point, will produce entropy increase, which will inevitably produce entropy increase. The organizational structure is lax, internal corruption occurs, the organizational structure is too bloated, and the information transmitted from top to bottom is opaque. Startups tend to be transparent, but the more opaque they get. Why is Newton's theory of mechanics layer after layer, layer after layer, as long as one part breaks, he can mention new ones on the Internet, then if it's you"}{"message": true, "content": "Is a part of this company, you are facing layoffs at any time, and what about the experience you have accumulated over the years? How do you deal with the rest of your life? So the next approach I recommend is Darwinian steamy tissue, not mechanical. Today, we have to say that our respect for Darwin is a little bit less than that. We don't believe in Darwin's theory of evolution, we don't believe that man evolved from language, we don't believe that man evolved from a single cell, not within known structures or known systems that we humans can detect. In the universe, only the living things on the earth will have anti-entropy increase, and only the biological tissue is the anti-entropy increasing tissue. Why would you say that? Because biological tissue naturally mutates, Darwin said that variation plus selection and isolation is ultimately equal to evolution. Then why are some of our other mechanical organizations afraid to innovate? Let's think about it. Why don't they dare to innovate? Because I already have vested interests, why should I innovate? Is that the truth? I already have a steady diet. Why should I innovate? But this is contrary to Darwin's natural selection, survival of the fittest, why do not dare to innovate? Why do you keep your one-third mu of land motionless? Why do we lack innovation? It is said that we have no respect for Darwin's father, but the origin of this species is not respected enough. if you are Newton's closed mechanical system, then you will eventually be faced with even less business, which is why many unicorns, big companies will eventually die out. How powerful do you think Baidu is? why didn't Baidu beat today's Jinri Toutiao? Cognitive confinement, Li Yanhong five years later realized what Zhang Yiming had done? So I say that we don't have enough respect and respect for Mr. Darwin today. Of course, we may also be in life, no one will tell us, or no one will remind us of how powerful Father Darwin is, not just living things, yes, not just living things.\nthirty-one\nThen I will say some nonsense, ah, then I will say some nonsense. If a person is strong and immoral, he can make the vast majority of people sacrifice for him, or if people are willing to sacrifice themselves, when they are willing to be sacrificed for you, you get what you deserve. But this is nonsense, as soon as they walk away, their time, their thoughts, they are talking about who is interested in what you say, and when people can sacrifice for you, you basically get what you want. If this time is coupled with your strong cognition, are you talking about starting a business? Well, I'm talking about starting a business.\nthirty-two\nWhat do young people need most? I think the first and most important point for young people is that first of all, you have to be aggressive, and then the second point is that people block the belief or momentum of killing the Buddha. This is the most important, money. Wait for some other so-called external resources, or secondly, first of all, you have to be valuable, and then you have to have the ability to quickly iterate over your cognitive scope and learning, so you can't be lazy. When you start a business, you can't be lazy. I'm sure you can't be lazy. I told you there was no plan. I thought about it at the beginning. I thought about what you could do if you failed. If you fail, you can learn the approximate optimal solution within the acceptable range of experience. You have to find out why you failed. Things are right. Failure is failure. In you, look for reasons from yourself. Then you have to correct your mindset, you are not a failure, you are just trying a way that does not work, this story is not finished, and then go on to tell the next story, constantly optimize, this is why you will you this rate of growth and the speed at which you iterate your own cognition, you can build. The first team, then you fail, how do you fail? Why did the team break up? If you consider every step carefully, the team will break up, the team will leave one or two people, but this is also a very normal phenomenon, you are very important, you exist this team exists, this thing exists. How can it be wrong if there is no money? Then here comes your problem. If you don't recognize you with money, how can you be rich? How can you be rich if you don't understand the nature of money? What kind of behavior have you done to prevent the money from coming to you? What kind of ability do you have to prevent the money from coming to you? Do you really want to get more start-up capital or the first bucket of start-up capital for yourself? Are you working in the right direction? What does your effort come from? Your thinking, your thinking comes from your cognition. Where does your cognition come from? No one can eat a fat sun in one mouthful, the geographer said live. What you say is very objective. The land master.\nthirty-three\nI am not a blogger famous for my good looks. I have never said that I am good-looking, but where does the beauty of the man who we are good-looking come from? In fact, beauty comes from fragility, no one is not fragile, to be honest, there is no one who is not fragile, I, including me, also have fragile times, but it is precisely because you are fragile, you still insist, this is called a fucking warrior. Everyone has a fragile time, no matter how strong the team, no matter how strong, he also has sleepless nights, fragile things can not be said, but you only face such fragility, and then you insist on this matter, you go to war, no one is not afraid of death, but no one does not want to live. How does the sun set up Wechat? In the case of Wechat, I think if you want to set up Wechat or set up Wechat in a team, first of all, you must be a capable person, and secondly, you must be a spiritual leader. This is very important. That is, spiritual leaders should have many comprehensive qualities. First, they should be able to lead people. At the most critical moment, they should be able to keep the team focused, and then know how to employ people. Then, for everyone's interests, ah, and what everyone really wants, you should not be lazy and understand. You should bring a dumpling. In fact, the most important thing is that you can't go in the wrong direction first. It is so important that you have a clear judgment and clear understanding of this matter. When people see that you are like a shot in the arm, this is very important. To have this ability, why can't sincerity be exchanged for sincerity? do you have to trade sincerity for sincerity? are we thinking a little bit? is the pattern a little smaller? how can sincerity be exchanged for it? The word \"sincerity\" is no longer valid as soon as you say it.\nthirty-four\nYou remember that today's post-zero, or even post-05th, post-10o, including a small number of post-90s, they must be people who can catch this hint of dividend. Certainly, we no longer need businessmen in the future, because the essence of a businessman's money is that he has a source of goods, but now the information is becoming more and more transparent, and your source of goods is what the price is. Businessmen and businessmen just know the source of goods. Pour one hand from the middle, and then make a price difference, but as the information becomes more and more transparent and the price becomes more and more average, there will no longer be so many businessmen in this market in the future. most of what he is doing in the self-media is a business of buying and selling. In the future market, he does not have the ability to become a new wave of wealth. What is the new wave of people? The new wave of rich people should be young people who create value and unique value, they are the next step, so the future value should return to the individual, the individual is the advent of the era of personal enterprise, or the advent of the visualization era of personal information nodes, this is the next trend of creating wealth, the next trend of creating wealth, rather than you buying and selling in the middle, this thing does not produce any value. It doesn't seem so easy to create. You remember today's post-zero generation. Even after 2005, the post-10s group, including a small number of post-90s, they must be able to catch this trace of bonus, for sure.\nthirty-five\nWhy the future business model is people-oriented, no one, there is no business, unless you do business with robots, you make this product is you have a premise, right? When you have a premise, you will develop your product according to your premise, then the problem arises, your premise, do you want to sell, ah, you have a trading relationship, right? When you have a business relationship, who is buying your product and selling it to whom? What threshold do you want to break through? What market signal are you trying to break through? these are all people. Economics, economics or sociology are all studying things, he is studying a phenomenon, he is studying the phenomenon itself, economics is studying the economic phenomenon itself, sociology is studying the social phenomenon itself, statistics is studying the phenomenon itself, he is studying the phenomenon, but what is behind these phenomena? Some people are talented to produce such a phenomenon. Philosophy studies people themselves, while all disciplines such as economics study phenomena.\nthirty-six\nEspecially people who do business, people who want to start a business, people who want to be an entrepreneur, what you have to do is to make a strategy, this thing is very important, the specific implementation is the following people, if you want to start a business, this is very important, you want to do strategy, what is strategy for? Strategy is the number of specific implementations that determine the direction of your business and whether it can survive or not. But the face of the person, he can only reach that state, then he is worthy to do such a thing. Strategy. Why? It is divided into two words, one is to fight, who to fight, how to fight, and the other is slightly, slightly, I don't do anything, I can't do anything, then this violates the law of simplicity on a large scale, is rooted in one-tone disadvantage, does not let you do anything, omits something, and then you know why to fight, this is very important, this is a founder, entrepreneurs want to see how far you can see, this is very important. Large-scale simplicity is uniform, specific practice, that is the following, he can only have people at this level of practice, then at this time can use money to solve the problem, what is my financing? I financing is the following people who work for me, he does not know, he is not enough to become a leader of the enterprise, then he can only do the following work. The time to buy him with money is over, but if you want to unite them, you have to use morality, that is, whether ontology is the only thing to follow or a master, and how long this enterprise can do, it all depends on how far your yardstick is, but you only earn money for a year or two, whether it's for listing or whatever, how big the scale of this thing is, you can see how far it is. When you formulate a strategy, you are not looking at the profits of a year or two. When you become a unicorn ten years later, you will naturally have fewer competitors. If you put the scale of competition within two or three years, or half a year, there will certainly be a lot of people competing with you. If you set the yardstick to ten years later, 20 years later, will there be very few people competing with you, because no one can see that far? So how much you can do depends entirely on what kind of frame you stand on and decide on your ass?\nthirty-seven\nWhat does the world need? What the world needs are pioneers, pioneers and conquerors. There is a saying that do not walk meekly into that good night, damn it, do not walk meekly into that good night, first solve the problem of food and clothing, and then consider anything else? In this society, you can't starve to death. In my opinion, the food and clothing you have to solve is relative food and clothing, and there are some things that you can take or not. Only by taking off your useless clothes and armor can you travel light and abandon yourself, or leave your native land or land, and you will be able to travel light and go on a great voyage, right? If you are still attached to your native land, or to what you have acquired in the past, you will never be a pioneer or pioneer. You see when Columbus sailed, what did he bring, nothing but the crew and the compass? When you go home, you think that if the development is over, your whole life will be over. It is not that the greater the ability, the greater the responsibility, you will. Have been on the road of development, some even you will be tired to death, tired to death after ah, go home, I think this life is worth it"}{"message": true, "content": "Didn't you just go home? What else can you do? Can you take things like house, money, fame and fortune with you? There is nothing to take away, after the development, give it to the young people, let them drive away, and you will go home.\nthirty-eight\nThe most important thing for an employee, I think, is that an employee is the most important. In the company, he always knows what his value is. It makes sense for people like you to exist all the time. First, don't make stupid requirements, and second, maybe optimize things that shouldn't exist at all. Article 3 forms automation, Article 4 forms scale, and Article 5 forms self-organization. Some people are wrong on the first rule. If you put forward a need that should have existed, then you should optimize the demand that should exist. This is the saddest thing, indicating that you have not seen it clearly. You can raise your salary, you can be fired, you can raise your salary. First, you can tell me what kind of goal you want to achieve in the future, what kind of goal you want to achieve, and what kind of return you want to get. If you achieve this goal, you can do it yourself. I don't set goals for you, you set goals for yourself, this goal you set is really what we need, and this goal you set is really the need that should have existed. But now there is no existence, how much money you want, how much money you give you, it all depends on whether you can do it or not. If the boss assigns you a job, he arranges your job, and you don't know what you're going to do, then you don't need to exist, you don't need to take this salary, because your existence is entirely because I tell you what you're doing, what you're doing, then you have no internal drive, right?\nthirty-nine\n\nIf you have the ability, CEO for you to do, I take the initiative to line up under you, I work for you, if you have the entire overall C position, you see further, CEO for you to do, you do not mention the salary increase, just change to you to do it. Really, if there is such a person, our goal is to make the company better and the industry more prosperous, not a question of who has the final say, the wrong person has the final say, and it is useless to lead the company into a different picture. To what extent will you design the control? I will not design the control to any extent. I will not control it. I just give the underlying logic. After I give the bottom series, the design is entirely their own business. The design should have positive feedback. You give the underlying logic. For example, I only give you a piece of genetic information about DNA. Any product should grow through self-organization, and it grows out on its own. First, It has to adapt to the external environment, which is the external environment of the whole market. Second, it should have the ability of self-iteration and self-evolution, and third, it should be able to reproduce. All my creatures have the underlying information of their genes. Just give the DNA code and water it. You can't be alone. Calculate, you can't control every design, but just tell him not to add anything superfluous and give the underlying chain to them. As for what kind of design the market needs and what kind of design they want to make, the market will naturally give them positive feedback, you do not need control, you die as soon as you control, then you are not a machine? How can you judge, you decide that the future is right, there is positive feedback, this is the most important one, and then self-organization, self-growth. This is me, this is what I mean by meta-universe, like a large APP factory or a large platform factory, there will be countless APP coming out, APP from various industries, but their unified underlying logic is the same, or the underlying logic of all these platforms is the same, but you will see that all kinds of creatures have evolved, just give the DNA code. I'm not a company. We're like an ant colony, a school of sardines.\nforty\nDon't control, you design, you can't control much, so I said, from the main road to Jane, how can you control how everyone grows, no, just like today's university, what's the use of learning a lot of idiots? Adapt to the freedom of the market, free market economy? Is there any positive feedback? For one thing, you can't memorize books and read dead books, this organization is an organization, and then type, self-organization, self-growth, self-evolution iteration. Positive feedback on this thing is right. Long gave birth to nine sons, although they are all dragon's sons, but each child is different. This is the model of the future company. There cannot be a middle one, there is a board of directors or a boss CEO meeting. How about this thing? just like the son of Zhou, all the princes called him one, and they all called him, Zhou Wen, King of Zhou, right? King of Zhou. Although you are a princess in the world, you tell every vassal state what you can do and what I can't do. After a few simple rules, you will grow up and grow up to become the people's Republic of China. It is very simple. First, the word \"Chinese nation\" is determined first. No matter what country it is, it is a member of the Chinese nation. Right, isn't it? then you can go to crusade, right, you can crusade, you can invade other things, those who taught Qin people in Qi Chuye Sea during the warring States period, you can go, but you crusade, the unified one is still called Daqin, or the Chinese nation, right? Then, is it right when the foreign enemy invades? You, such as Manchu, Manchu, you, such as Mongolians, when you, such as Japanese, come, will we resist? In the end, it is still the people's Republic of China today. You can't control it. All you have to do is give him a few simple positive feedback. Although the hundred-ethnic bug is dead but not stiff, eggs cannot be released into Iran. So why are we a decentralized organization, that is, as long as one thing gets up, it immediately becomes a network, and then he analyzes it, and then meets again, and then analyzes it again in this way, and he makes a deal again? this is an internal competition and an internal Darwinian competition, a competition of modern Darwinism, extinction and new output. We also have to produce this kind of competition mechanism within us, coupled with the entire external market, it is also a competition mechanism, but the only difference is that many external organizations are mechanical organizations with a center, but we do not have a center. You cut me off. This leg, I still have that leg, you cut off this leg, I still have a leg, although the 100-foot bug dies but does not fall, just like the octopus's paw, right? The claw of an octopus equals that there are neurons on each claw, it does not rely on the brain, you cut off the brain like a man, and this is not necessary, because the octopus in the center of a friend is not, the octopus is neither an octopus nor a starfish, you cut off a guitar, it can grow, and then there is another structure to let the heart and egg go. So KK has a book called out of control, don't control, Out of control, get out of control.\nforty-one\nWhatever has been designed for you, does not follow the way of Heaven, this is not the underlying push layer, we are now many companies have made one of the most serious problems, that is, as the CEO of a company, as the CEO of a company, I always think about where I am going to take the company, no, wrong, not where I took the company, but I just injected the simplest and most primitive DNA pheromone into this company. Then it began to grow on its own. It was grown, not designed. The company has to be grown, not designed. It's very simple. Everyone here is designed by your parents, isn't it? It's all a natural combination of sperm and egg, your father gave some DNA sequence, your mother gave some DNA sequence, and then grew and combined, and then slowly developed into who we are now, right, and then slowly developed your own life now, right? who has designed for you, whatever has been designed for you, does not follow heaven, this is not the bottom rule, including education, education is to let you grow on your own. To be able to grow better, that's what he means, not to control you, to control you. If you control you, there will be more and more homogenization. CEO of an enterprise, he thinks it will develop like this in the future, so he takes all his employees in this direction. If it is wrong, once it is dangerous, the risk is particularly great. Once CEO decides this thing, as long as there is a logical one, your business empire collapses, is the only best way to disperse Zhaoxian Master? Everyone is good at different areas, you do not have to control him, you tell him what the underlying gene is, you can play freely according to this underlying gene, you are completely free of the goals you have set for yourself, you are an organization, you are a small group, to complete this thing, that is the most important thing. You can't say that a leader tells you what to do, and you and he are right. Then the staff will be dissatisfied, isn't it? Why is what you say is right? I think this is the right thing to do. Our team thinks this is the right thing to do. If you tell us in a piece of paper that this cannot be done, then what value do I have in your company? do you want to break this into parts? he is very good at this.\nforty-two\nThis test management, there is no management to manage yourself, if you delegate power to everyone, this person will think that what owns this thing, this is the biggest positive feedback, just like you have a company, you have shares, and when you have done this thing, you can go out on your own, set up your own company, and you can set up your own company. Your small team thinks that this thing, ah, can, ah, you can manage this company by yourself. all the money you earn belongs to you, but the control is control, or your ownership, and the ownership belongs to us, but you can, ah, this company is completely in addition to shares, it's all business, it's all your own. You can also come back and operate with us how you want to run it, right? Or you can cooperate. You can't delegate power. I think you can delegate power. I think you can give them back what originally belonged to them. This is also my idea. Give them back what originally belongs to them. If the sky is gone, it's gone. If it's gone, it's gone. To delegate power to him is to let him really give them back what belongs to them. If he really wants to be independent, ah, but if this thing is delegated to you, he can also give you the shares, but when I need you in the future, when you get it, we will have another mechanism. It's the annihilation system, the positron annihilation mechanism, when I need you, you have to come back, you can have money, you can have status, but when I need you again, you have to come back, maybe we'll do something else together.\nforty-three\nGive them back what originally belongs to them, they will work for themselves, this is my own, so that your organization can be infinitely huge, understand? What if you don't come back? If you don't come back, you won't come back. If you don't come back, he has contributed to the whole economy, not mine. He has contributed to the whole scripture. He has contributed to the whole innovation, and it does not belong to me. If the fate is met, it will be born, and if the fate is scattered, it will perish. Our overall culture is that as long as this person likes the organization, he will come back and want the spirit of innovation. Why can there be so many companies in Silicon Valley? It's not Silicon Valley that dominates the world, and it's not that I want to make a lot of money as a business, that's what it looks like, how much money you get, how big the company is, not all companies are people working, people are the most important, I think so. Brother, this is China, no matter where it is, this applies. Don't think that this organization is out of control. We only do it in China. As I said, although the hundred-legged bug doesn't die stiff, you can't just stand in China, can you? You can't just stand in China. I can have business in China, but I'm a hundred-footed bug. I broke China. A leg, and something else."}{"message": true, "content": "ah, there are also those who do this in china. they operate independently, independently account, independently operate, independently account. what does he want to do? He wants to refine, even quantify, every person in China, not this organization. If this organization is bigger, how big can it be? It's like starting out with a bunch of chaotic matter, and then the chaotic matter slowly changes into something, into a single cell something, and then the single cell A becomes something, and then it evolves into an internal competition mechanism similar to this, and then the internal competition mechanism A develops up, and then it becomes something, replicable, and then replicable, and then it changes up, and it forms a plant, and then the plant forms up, and it forms spores. The spores spread out again, and that's it. A person is a person, a chaotic substance, one person at a time. It's both a beginning and a starting point for self-growth. It has no ability, but it also has unlimited ability. That's it. Just like I told you before, Nian Jun, why can he form this thing? As long as you return what originally belongs to him, he will study for himself. Electrons are spinning, and people are self-selecting.\n44\nWhy do people nowadays lie flat and not hang themselves? It is because of this economic loss that people who were supposed to hang themselves cannot hang themselves. They want to work but have no job. They want to rise but have no channel. You say that you have built so much infrastructure and have nothing to do with ordinary people. Then everyone can only turn screws and have no ideas in their minds. Then your innovation still depends on the elite class and connections. Then it leads to young people who originally had dreams in factories. Once the factory screws are screwed, they really become screws. The channels for promotion at the bottom are gone. Do you think you can find good jobs by relying on modern imperial examinations and universities? If you find good jobs, you will also enter a mechanical, mechanical company, and you will become a screw. However, your screw is not unique. Your screw is not scarce. Batch after batch of screws are produced from universities. Do you think you will be scarce? Then it turns up, is it necessary to see clearly this problem, the real free market economy, and it must be the marginal value network, with the vitality of innovation of the marginal value network, the vitality of the whole market can rise, so why do I say give back what originally belongs to them, right? It's a market re-economy that can pick up. the way.\n45\nI appreciate Zhang Yiming's words that young people should do challenging things, young people should do difficult things, he limits your innovation, because what? Limiting your innovation is because no one behind you takes the blame for you. As a result, we don't, what should you do? We take the blame for you. Someone has to go to hell, right? Well, let's just say that everyone blindly refuses to change things, and then goes directly back to the Cultural Revolution. I tell you, you must have this sense of hardship in your mind. If you see that others think that the current market economy is dissatisfied, they put forward this idea. You see that they say it, you only see that you are watching, but the sickle is not on your head yet. When the sickle really falls, there is no one to help you appeal, to help you shout. They are also watching you. Just like I saw that Zhengzhou University student appealing for release, they have been locked up in the dormitory for a month, there are a lot of university students watching the fun, but the sickle has not really cut on your head, once the sickle is on your head, you want to ask others for help, you are not already numb. The market economy is the same, when everyone is numb and does not change, then directly return to the attic to follow you. If you want the market to continue to thrive, the only thing that matters is. There is nothing to expect, right? It was like this 5000 years ago, and it will still be like this 5000 years later. It is very difficult to change your innovation because of domestic restrictions. What is the reason why he restricts your innovation? The innovation in my heart is because no one is behind you to carry the blame, in the end we don't, what should you do, we are supporting you, someone has to go to hell, right? Then I'm an innovator going to hell. This country is basically hopeless. So, so, I have to use a heavy hammer. It's not easy. Someone has to do it. I appreciate Zhang Yiming's words that young people should do challenging things and young people should do difficult things. I agree very much with Zhang Yiming that young people should do challenging and difficult things.\n46\nWhat have we relied on for the past 30 years? The development of unadvanced light industry, export of real estate, and then the stock market, these three carriages, then now China's stock market do not need me to talk about what virtue, everyone should know, 70% of the common people's real estate, now rotten, a lot of houses can not be sold, all hit the hands, export gains have increased a little. In the past 30 years, the development relied on three, but the market rules of these three were not very sound, so many people could make money as long as they were bold, so today these people are on the horse claw, what do you mean? It's different from the way they played in the past. In the past, you can make money if you mess around. The earliest batch of people went into the sea, you can make money however you want. But today is different. Is China a big assembly country? We pull other people's components and assemble them, and then sell them to earn a manual fee. Otherwise, light industry, clothing, shoes and socks, toys and light bulbs are not enough for our own domestic demand. We didn't start with innovation. In addition, the inertia you have formed in the past 30 years, the inertia you have formed in the past 30 or 40 years, no one is willing to innovate. Another one. Innovation is at great risk, and you say that there are our own reasons for the roll. And now. But the way to think about it is how to find a new breakthrough in the next 30 years. This is a new direction for the problem, right? Your fertility rate is so low now that it is unlikely that you will just sell your house. This is what I think a new generation of entrepreneurs will think about from 2023. It is not easy for a new generation of entrepreneurs to think about it. I believe it will get better. I always have a sense of hardship, but I am more optimistic about the future, but I have a sense of hardship, you have to see that its overall development will be better and better, you think there is a reliance, or there is a backer will give you to do this thing, but there is nothing reliable here, no one can decide for me, I have no one I can finally rely on, only myself, everything will be better. Sometimes it's like boiling frogs in warm water. To be honest, after being boiled frogs, people have run away. High-tech industries, Tencent, Ali, Jingdong and bytes all don't speak now. If there is any situation, we have no chip first and no engine second. The chip engine is not made by ourselves. If you fight, it will be a high salary. Technology industry, you these are not domestic, aircraft carrier engines, aircraft engines, submarine engines, automobile engines are not. Therefore, if it were me, I would still first solve the livelihood of the common people and first develop the economy. This is the most important thing. So the only thing we have to do, young people who want to start businesses after 90, is to push forward under pressure. Really can only be like this, bear the pressure to rush forward, we can only do these things, you do not do, then all lie down, all lying soldiers, you want to go back? Do you want to? Do you want to wear grey again? Do you want to make another ostrich with its head in the sand? Anyway, I think it's wrong for you to go abroad. You have to push forward under pressure. You have to push forward under pressure. There's no way. It reminds me of Sun Yat-sen. I'm not Dr. Sun. I respect him very much. I respect Dr. Sun very much, but I'm not as good as Dr. Sun.\n46\nOnly in this way is the best way to break the hierarchy, as long as you can study your favorite field, and then cooperate with others, and finally form a business, you can make money, you can not take the university exam, you can not need that diploma, do not need, I said as long as I do not die, I will always do this, because we are now missing is hope that there is now a second generation of Internet What problem? That is, the labeling problem. This labeling problem easily hinders or hinders the way information is distributed. It easily hinders the possibility of many people growing up on different types. The same is true for chatter. Its algorithm mechanism is too information liberation, so an account can only send videos of the same vertical category. It is impossible for young people to have more opportunities to extend or even cooperate with others. His whole system determines that he has a premise that information is looking for people. However, in our opinion, the way he distributes this information is not enough to reflect, because what we lack now is hope. That is, what we lack now is how to enable young people to find a new living space in this market, or a new ecological niche, or a new living niche, how to better realize their own lives, including children's education, how they can join an autonomous chaotic flight when they first learn to speak, when they go to kindergarten, and then let them study all the fields that they are interested in. People with the same hobbies, they themselves are a diverse organization, want to develop, want to grow, then in this case, whether you go to university, whether you graduate or not is actually not important, as long as you can study your favorite field, and then cooperate with others, finally form a business, you can make money, you can, you can not take the university exam, you can not need that diploma, do not need, you just what you are suitable for, you do what. Of course, of course, this society also needs people who can only listen to other people's orders and do things. Then let them enter the kind of people who listen to others 'orders. We are only saying that we are trying to stimulate more vitality in this market and more diversity in products, or say scientific research, or say education, or say other fields, other fields or such ideas. In fact, I have no way to think about it, because I have said it before. You know whether he is a particle or a wave function. I don't know. It's like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat. In our eyes, if every user on our platform is Schr\u00f6dinger's cat in our eyes, because you don't know when you will observe it, it may be another identity, because the information on this platform is not fixed, or the label is not fixed. You may see him today as a composer. Tomorrow he could be a poet. I was doing this, and it occurred to me that there was a philosopher who said, Cole Cable, that when you say my name. It negates the possibility of me becoming someone else. When I finally finished thinking about this thing, I saw Kohlkegaard saying this sentence, um, it was a little interesting, because this world is chaos and classification. Of course, I will try my best to try this model. I said that as long as I don't die, I will always do this. This is what we think. What is the end point? Have you thought about it? I think there is no end point, because chaos branches themselves have no end point. I think he will leave behind a cornerstone of creation, he will bring a cornerstone of creation to the whole region and the whole country, that young people are no longer subject to, this is the way we want to achieve, I can't say more, because only in this way is the best way to break down the hierarchy, because everything is based on people, and people themselves are valuable. You sell products, then how do you sell products? You are the boss of a supply chain. You have mastered the supply chain. How can you feel that the market needs your things? Why can't you distribute the redundant resources to young people? Young people may need it more, young people who do laboratories in old factories,"}{"message": true, "content": "Why can't you know that they have more ideas than you? it's just that they don't have the resources. Human nature is uncontrollable. What do you care if human nature is uncontrollable? The fact that you care that human nature is controllable means you want to control it.\nforty-seven\nThe supreme way to make money is that you don't think about how much you earn, let each other earn first, let them earn first, and then you can make money after they earn. This is the supreme way to make money. What kind of mindset is this? To understand Li Ka-shing, to put it simply, it is sprinkled with rice and brushed chicken. I sprinkled a handful of rice and brought in the chicken. I have eggs only when the chicken is full. Maybe I still have chicken. How much does a handful of rice cost, but what do I get? I got far more than rice. As said, for example, what is meant by giving, ah, the highest method of giving, I will let you earn first, this is a bit utilitarian, ah, I will let you earn first, I do not want to feel from you, ah, what kind of person I make you think I am, I just let you earn first, when you earn, you live well. Only when you live well can you consume, and when you consume well, you can drive your household consumption, and when your household consumption is good, you can drive the consumption of the whole society and the consumption of the whole society, and only people like me can make money.\nforty-eight\nYes, my wife is worth it today. I feel that it is the overseas study company that will be able to join the broadcasting service tonight. Then our company has been doing it for about two years, that is, during the epidemic. Now it is possible to lose 10 or 20 per year in the last two years. Er, the question I want to consult is actually not about my career. I would like to consult about one aspect of my personal ability improvement. I also want to be with the people around me, for example, when they are 26 or 7 years old, ah, they already have relatively good grades, and then they can live the kind of life they want. I also want to, er, catch up with the pace of their life, so now I want, er, how to adjust my mentality. Because now one of my former friends in the same circle is unable to provide me with an emotional value, that is, there is no way to communicate some things. I have a lot of people in the same circle, for example, some of my friends in the same industry, er, some things cannot be explained, so now I want to understand how to adjust a little better from this state of mine. I generally understand, ah, right. I have a question about who you are when speaking improperly. I think as long as I create the point of value that I want to achieve, I can find a direction in life, and I can find out the direction of life, and I can figure out who I am, the other way around. I don't have to find out who you are first, and then have a dream, ah, ha, that's the same as when we, um, just opened up, everyone didn't understand what the market economy was all about. I was confused and killed in it. You think this is a big problem for me, and I am also slowly adjusting it. This is not the crux of the problem. In fact, what you have just pointed out is that no one can lead you to this, um, emotional value, or that you feel that you can study abroad, overseas study institutions, ah, and then there are a lot of things that can be done in a year, more than a dozen or more than 20. Then I feel that only by doing this can I reflect the value of my life. In fact, this thing is external, haven't you found it? Well, you have to provide you with emotional value through external people. I want you to have heard that after you have done this, you need to get a recognition of yourself, yes, and then you are still worried about you every day. You only have 12 puppets every day. In fact, the problem is that you don't understand why you want to do this, and that's why I ask this question. Who are you? After asking who you are and why you did this, I can understand one of my original reasons for doing this thing at that time. I used to be an amateur athlete. I was a relatively good person in my classmate group. No matter from that appearance, or EQ, relatively speaking, my peers, I was a little better than them, so I did this at that time. Why? Because when I was in the institution of studying abroad at that time, I thought they were very bad at it, and then I wanted not to do it myself, and then when I happened to have this opportunity at that time, I wanted to be there. and at that time, I was actually born in the ordinary working class, and then, um, I felt that if I went to study abroad, I felt that I had found a job equivalent to a pretty good job as soon as I graduated. My consumption level was also relatively improved at that time, and I wanted to reduce the burden on my family when I was studying abroad. Yes, this is my very real original intention, that is, these two reasons have set up this organization, right, so what I actually think is relatively simple, ah, it is like this, that is to say, if you really want to start a business, or if you really want to do something, that is, in the first place, ah, in our opinion, there are a lot of people who really kill them without thinking about anything. Yes, this thing will bring a big hidden, hidden risk in it, um. When we want to figure out how to do this, every step I will take, in fact, is to see what this equal sense is equivalent to, equivalent to water without a source and a tree without roots, to you, what you just said to yourself, for example, your self-confidence in yourself. I very much approve of this. I very much like this. Because very few people are confident in themselves because of this idea, but they are far from confident enough in themselves. Um, when we first started this enterprise, we had a standard enterprise relative to others, or we had a standard with others, that is, compared to others, what I was good at, and what I believed he was right about. But these things are actually not the reason why I want to do this thing. Oh, this kind of thing, oh, I just suddenly thought of it again. A fundamental reason why I did this at that time was because I was born into this kind of teacher family, that is, my parents. Then when I graduated at that time, I originally wanted to continue to do this education career, that is, I felt that I had an advantage in this respect, and the second I could get from it, that is, er, an expression of my own value was that I would be a little impetuous recently. If you, you, if you go on in this state, you will be more impetuous, OK. I just think I just want to ask the eldest brother about my, er, things that are more important to me at this stage. What is it? That is, apart from my usual work, I dare not say that what I said is right, mm-hmm, but I will not talk about business, the underlying logic of business, or this, um, specific you want to run a company, how do you do, how do you know people? I won't talk about this question, um, because now you give me the feeling that there is a you in the middle, you are standing in the middle. You are standing on a huge trampoline, which is, and then there are several people standing next to you, but everyone's weight is different. As long as there is a person jumping up next to you, who is lighter than you, you don't pay attention to him. If you are heavier than you, you will break it to him. I can't catch it, that is, what I have described now is very in place, that is, I am in exactly the same state right now. So I came back to your question at the beginning, what should you do? I think it's better to go back to yourself, who you are, because when you do this thing, it comes from you. Let's not talk about the big market for studying abroad. I won't talk about it first, that is to say, no matter how big the market for studying abroad is, I don't know. I really don't know why I want to do this thing, it's definitely not me or I ask you that question, who are you, why do you do this, what is that reason? How do you make me feel now? It is what you recognize, in fact, it is not you. What you approve is this thing about the record of studying abroad. When you get it done, you can achieve it, you thinker. Right, now we are in such a state, that is, I just talked about knowing yourself. My sentence may sound relatively simple. You are now 27 years old, when you are over 30 years old, and then when you are 35 years old and 40 years old. If we are still like this. More anxious, because my self-perception is actually not very clear. At this stage, I have been in this state for several months. In fact, there is another way, ah, but I don't know if you accept, um, to become a monk for half a year. But there are many entrepreneurs like this. Young entrepreneurs go to become a monk for half a year. Six months, and then go to work, I will tell you more now, in fact, in your heart, because your sight now is not on yourself, but all on the outside, it is that too much of my sight is on the outside. I find that it has been swallowed up, so it is missing. I only understand one thing you need to understand, that is, even if you are an institution of study abroad, I assume that this institution of yours will make a lot of money in the future, even if it is listed. Um, you will still be in pain, and you will still be in pain. Besides, if you are in this company now, maybe you just said that you are not an important position, then you may still have your vision on the outside, that is, there is no way to achieve the expected effect that you expected in an important position, and then you will have this kind of self-doubt. I was not like this before. It is the sense of certainty in my heart that I have disappeared and disappeared a lot. I think I should be the person I was before the important thing, and then I should look for the question of who I am. When you understand who you are, you will have universal wisdom. I will give you a simple when you have, when you know who you are, the first to really understand who you are, you will have a large-scale worldview. Well, the simplicity of seeing things directly to the essence, and the only reason I know why I want to do this, but what's the problem you're in right now? You have four points. First, subjectively oriented evidence screening. I am much better than others. I used to be an athlete. I am better than my peers in appearance and appearance, ah, the same circle, and other subjectively oriented evidence screening. Second, the footage of your vision pattern in the past few months or at the beginning of your choice of this career proves that, third, your present thing has not reached the embarrassment of the evolution of your specific expected current issue. Fourth, the debate pattern of the specific position we are discussing here, because you have not come out to be taught. Today's wife is straight. I feel that you can join the wheat tonight. I hope you can understand this. That is, I am still that thing, we have to look at ourselves first, look at ourselves. Put that perspective of observing others on yourself, and then you can solve all these problems, and then you will have a sense of certainty when you do things. When you have a sense of certainty about yourself, the people who follow you, they believe in you, because people and people don't say how much money you have or how much money you have. In fact, what people believe in in the end is actually the value and utopia that emanates from yourself.\nforty-nine\nI want to tell you one thing, Tai, that is, I did not apply for a sample business with a special partner before. At that time, er, I used part of what you said during the live broadcast, ha, in the middle, for investment, including a methodology for thinking about things, later, I was successfully admitted to that school. Of course, what we have here is a successful and very successful case. And I was left with only one school that was quite congra, very congra, but behind me, but I didn't go there, because I thought, er, I was just running away, because you know I was actually quite influenced by my native family. I had to break free from, er, this kind of, um, civil service, public examination, editing, ah, because,"}{"message": true, "content": "We all know this in our place, so at that time I still thought about this problem in the end. I think it was very valuable to me, because my sister has been doing it for two years, so I haven't had any big enlightenment yet. Although I have endured some colleagues to death, I don't think it was a successful thing. Then I thought about leaving a way out for myself, and then I also had an explanation for my family. I have been thinking about this matter, but Later, I directly felt, um, I shouldn't escape anymore. I should just face this problem, just like I did with Tango today, that is, sincerely throw out these questions of mine. I don't think it's an embarrassing thing, so I think I'm still, ah, slowly improving. I think today's conversation is very helpful to me. Thank you again. It's okay. As long as there is something to gain, then you have to think about it carefully. You are only 27. It's okay, man. Before the age of 30, three or even 35, or even before the age of 40, a man's real strength is after the age of 40, OKOK, um, don't worry, don't worry, if you are in the big environment in China, everyone is fighting like a wolf, fighting for it, afraid of starving himself, in fact, he can't starve to death, what he wants is relative fate, compared to others, I can't be worse than him, he is not hungry to death, a bowl of pickles a steamed bun, who can starve to death, right? Yes, yes, calm down to know myself, and then think about what I want to do, and then write a plan, OOKOK.\n50\nNow there are very few opportunities for young people, very few, that is, no one is willing to help them. You don't have a certain threshold, you don't have funds, you don't have money, you don't have influence, or you don't know people, including a lot of this kind of incomprehension, or this kind of slander. Not many young people can withstand this kind of method, this kind of practice, so they will feel more and more that they don't know who they are, and then they dare not do anything. I think real innovation is just like the three points mentioned just now. I feel tired when I hear you say it. I don't want to care about those people at all. I used to be like this. I used to be like this. I also felt that I was full by myself and the whole family was not hungry. I always felt that something was wrong, because the money might not belong to me, so I felt that how to dig, dig, or explore some impossible things and some impossible things, I think this is the most important thing. What is the motivation of entrepreneurship? I have only a few simple rules, number one, that all men are created equal, and number two, that I think innovation is the root or source of all business or free market economies. And one of the things that I believe in Darwin's genesis, any business and any innovative organization or any innovative product, it must be. From the beginning, I was looked down upon by everyone, then I couldn't understand it, and then I couldn't catch up with me. So I think where is the biggest innovation paradigm? The paradigm of the greatest innovation is among ordinary people. I always believe this, which means that the same amount is equal to each other. However, there are very few opportunities for young people now, very few, that is, no one is willing to help them. No one is willing to say that you don't have a certain threshold, you don't have funds, you don't have money, you don't have influence, you don't know people, including many such incomprehensions, or such slander, or such shortcomings. The evaluation is not something that many young people can bear. This kind of method, this kind of practice, so he will feel more and more, more and more that he does not know who he is, and then dare not do anything. I think the real innovation is like the three points just mentioned. In fact, I haven't said all of them yet. He is in so many of them. It is still that sentence, one flower, one world, one tree, one bodhi. You see this young man now, maybe he is not very fun, but the self-drive of young people is very important, sometimes it gives you a good platform, it will give you a good opportunity, but you don't know it yourself, you don't grasp this opportunity, if you don't follow this opportunity, or you don't see this opportunity, you don't even know what you should do. No matter what kind of opportunity is placed in front of you, so I also added one more thing. As I said earlier, I believe that the origin of species, what can really survive from the market, is not the best thing, but the most suitable thing. The most suitable species is not your strongest, nor is it your weakest, the weakest and the strongest are likely to be eliminated, but the most suitable ones survive. I feel tired from hearing you say it. I don't want to care about these people at all. I used to be like this. I used to be like this. I was also like this. I also felt that I had enough to eat alone and the whole family was not hungry. That was quite good. I made money by myself, or I had the ability to earn money by myself. I could not care about it. I always felt that something was wrong. Fang always felt that something was wrong because the money might not belong to me. Therefore, I felt that how could I use this money on the other party? How could I dig? Or explore some impossible things and some impossible things, I know this kind, otherwise at the same time create this kind of opportunity for you, create this kind of platform for you, you also have to be able to know yourself and have self-drive, this is very important.\n51\nOnce you think like that, you are not far from failure, and giving up is not far from you. If you don't trust yourself, who can believe in yourself? Behind you is a cliff, or for me now, behind me is the dream of many young people. Then how can I let them lie down and want to participate in self-organization, want to do this, want to form multilateral transactions in this self-organization? Then I can't lie down. What if I lie down? You start a business on chatter, you start a business on Taobao, you try it now, you start a business on Jingdong, you try it first, you try it, right? You don't do it, I don't do it, every day, you scold every day, don't panic, you smile, so handsome. I know that some people may say, ah, if you promote a young person to fame, or if you develop these young people, what value do they have? I don't have a name, but I don't have anything. I think sometimes it may be the other way around. I feel brave enough to do the fact that the industry opposes consensus. Therefore, a kind of courage. I think it's quite good. It's quite interesting. Maybe one day I fall down. I don't succeed, but naturally someone will see it. Naturally, some people will see this pattern. Maybe I fall down, or other teams doing the same thing as me, or teams with more, er, whatever, more resources than us, they do it first, then you also bless, then also wish. The main thing is to say that you have a heart, that is, to say that you have a heart. If you don't change things, you don't cure them, right? If you don't make a reservoir, whether you do it or not is secondary. But whether you want to do it or not is another matter. If you don't have the heart to make this reservoir, then you will never be able to make a reservoir, not how to do it when storing water. If you want to make a reservoir to make money, that's one thing. If you say I have to do it anyway when storing water, Now although I do not know the method, but I have this heart, your heart does not change things do not buy it. Another point is that how much desire do you have for doing this thing? This desire is very important. If you say I, I, I do this thing now, if it doesn't sell well, then I won't do it? What if he seems discouraged at first, and I don't? No, it's still the thing you're sure of. You're sure whether this thing can be done. Sometimes you see, this thing, this place link is wrong, or that place link is wrong. Many people are discouraged. As an entrepreneur, you can't think like this, and you're not allowed to think like this. Once you think like that, you're not far from failure, and giving up is not far from you. If you don't trust yourself, who can believe in yourself? Behind you is a cliff. Or for me now, behind me is the dream of many young people. Then how can I make them lie down? If I want to participate in the autonomous organization, if I want to do this, if I want to form multilateral transactions in this autonomous organization, then I can't lie down. What will they do if I lie down? You like chatter entrepreneurship, you like Taobao entrepreneurship, you try now, you go to Jingdong entrepreneurship, you try first, you try right? You don't do it, I don't do it, I scold you every day, you scold me every day, isn't it worth it? What does life consist of? Life lies in tossing and turning, and the dwarfs in the form of giants in thought are hard to become market. Didn't Musk say that? What is entrepreneurship? Entrepreneurship is the process of chewing glass and staring at the abyss. I think the sun needs to find more people with the same frequency to grow bigger. I am not in a hurry. People, no matter what kind of scene or place they are in, self-drive will always be the first, including mentality, this angle of looking at things, pattern, and always these things you need to practice, or you will be finished, or you will be finished. If you start a business in this year, if you start a business, You see how many people want to start a business, right? Not many people feel that there is no chance to start a business, but in my opinion, there is actually an opportunity. Everyone feels that there is no chance. No, it is because you have not done one thing. The right thing for a man, the right thing for a man is one of the requirements, the heart is very important, the heart, the execution, the action, the mentality is a series of comprehensive strength, the business is still learning from you, especially the entrepreneur, you have to know the mentality, the mentality, and the original intention of you doing this thing, the original intention of you doing this thing is very, very important, if one day I am destroyed how to do? Rest assured there will be thousands to me, the spirit is immortal. So doing the right thing for a man is always the truth that I, I, I want to say. Which developed country in the world does not do the right thing for a man? It's challenging to do what's right for a man. Who else would do it?\n52\nIt's not the product I care about, it's the value of the person. No matter how many products you sell, how long a brand can live in China, and talent is the most valuable. Some of you may not understand what we are doing. Clothes are not woven by products, people are valuable products, people themselves are products, not products we make. Only when a person is valuable can he earn money by himself, and only then can he live out the meaning of his own life. If this meaning is based on his hobbies and what he is good at doing and earn money, this is better. Clothes themselves are not products, but talents are products, and people are nodes connecting all products. This is the essence of business. People themselves are products. Let me think about it for you. Business is inseparable from people. People are the smallest single factor that produces all production. If you only sell good products in this place, it is only about products. What I care about is the people gathered on this platform. The more people there are, the more transactions there are. What I care about is not the product, but the value of the person itself. No matter how many products you sell, how long can a brand live? Talent is the most valuable thing in the country. I want to make a pattern that keeps everyone here. There are only two most important information and energy in this universe. What if some people are worthless? There was no value. How did he say this value? He doesn't know anything. It's impossible for a person to know nothing. So ah, look at how you think. How can he be worthless if he only works on the bleeding line?\n53\nIn my opinion, 100 percent of the workers on the assembly line have their value, and 101 percent of them can identify how much value they see as proof of how much opportunity they see. If you think that the workers on the assembly line have no value, it proves that he is an opportunity in your life, and in my opinion, he is full of opportunities. Do you think a leaf falls from a tree, it rots, and it has no value? He just doesn't have the value you call him. The so-called value of people is also stipulated by the market or a certain model, which means that your model is not perfect, you have not formed a positive cycle, or even the cycle is incomplete. That's where the opportunity is. It's like eating something and digesting it, right? first by"}{"message": true, "content": "Stir your saliva, then swallow it, and then finally turn the horn, rule it out, right? Your drainage machine is of no value. What is the purpose of the sewage treatment plant? Chemical fertilizer, ah, and then the excreted thing, ah, finally becomes the water in the sprinkler, ah, it is all possible. You need to have a set of perfect information identification mechanisms and methods, so it is very important to do something difficult and correct, to do anti-consensus things in the industry, and to identify market opportunities, that is, your extraction and understanding of the information itself, and for the extraction of information.\nfifty-four\nI just want to tap the value of the initiative and make it easier for them to make money. If you don't accept it, you will kill me. If you can't beat me, you will add me. You imagine, if I am not the sun now, now I am a mediocre small role, there will be so many people watching me live? Will you? No, is there such a person who is willing to contribute his traffic? I don't think so, and there is a charge if there is any. Then I will do an opposite thing, donating my traffic to people who qualify for each period, without sharing their products, spending a world, and building a 100 million bodhi tree. How do you think this young man has no future and no hope? The way for a country to move forward depends on innovation, it depends on young people, which is based on the principle of Heisenberg plotting. As I said before, how do you know that these young people will not have a chance in the future? you are investing in them now. Yes, I just want to get this done. I don't want anything. I have another thing to do. I want to build rockets and aircraft. I just want to tell those people who can do this best. Who can expand the whole market from unilateral trading to multilateral trading, and then really serve users, real industrial chain, real supply chain, real value, real users. Real service, really transparent, who can do anything, I just want to tell you, that is, this is possible, don't donate any more, don't give it away, produce a suit, produce tens of thousands of pieces, and there's not so much demand in the market. I just thought, one day, when I'm old, when I'm sitting in that chair, when I'm dying, think back to who I've never been able to do in my life. What do you understand that you are doing charity? you look like we are doing charity, right? We are just doing what the industry is doing, we are just doing things, and the focus is not on making money. if these are correct, he will naturally make money, ah, if this is the right thing, if I come up to make money, and this is not the right thing, there are a lot of things I don't like, am I down-to-earth? So I chose to change.\nfifty-five\nDo you mean it's easy to do small things or to do big things? Can you tell me, is it easy to do small things or to do big things? In fact, I tell you that it is easy to do big things, but it is not easy to do small things. It is easy to do big things. It is also a business. Which is easier to earn 100000 or 10 million?. It's easy to earn 10 million, the time cost is about the same, you earn 100000 or 10 million, which do you want to do? Earning 100000 may be about the same as making it a little easier, and earning 100000 a month is about the same. In fact, you do big things, many people are summoned by you, many people are summoned by you, there are many talents, there are many talents, there are many resources, what you do is small, and most people do not like your mind and your other bureau. If you do small things, people will not be willing to agree to you. If you know that what you are doing is a big thing, your ocean is big and wide enough, when others come. It seems that you are not in the pond, you are not a fish pond eater, the fish pond can support you, you are worth following this person, even if you encounter problems in the process of doing great things, you know you finally know what you are going to do. Not because of one. Little things have to trap you, and if you do this, the plate is so big, then any problem in your cocoa will determine the problem of your whole plate. What if you do something big? Is it true that a glass of water weighs 34000, right? If you don't have a Buddha's eye, but the human eye is in the eye, and there is a fish, um, a fungus on one side, what if you take a look at the fire eye? Wow, it's full of bacteria, and every flora has a need for every flora. If you look at a girl with your eyes, you have to look at other people's faces with your eyes, and you have to look at other people's faces with your eyes. Handsome, too handsome, no, I would also like to fall in love with you to look at you with a microscope to try, all military groups, don't look at kissing yet. So it's always easier to do big things than to do small things. To be honest, you do small things, but you think you don't have the courage to do them all the time. You think small things are feasible, and there is a landing plan that can be implemented. So, you see, if you do one thing, ah, I quote Bezos of Amazon, if you do this thing, OK, you can do it in the next six months, one year or two years. Zero you find that you have a lot of competitors, even now, and this is your best. To do one thing, if he only creates short-term value, it matters no matter how much money he earns. If you take a long-term view, you find that no one can wait with you for ten years after ten years. You can rest assured that you are absolutely right to do this. There is another sentence to make it clear that if this thing is to create long-term value, it doesn't matter how much money he loses now, do something difficult but right, do something anti-pragmatic, do something big, and create long-term doctrine and long-term value. You think you've made money by making pancakes, and you've all gone to sell pancake fruits. Do you think you can do him for small things? Say that others do not dare to think, and think greedily, and have self-drive and internal drive at the same time.\nfifty-six\nNo matter what, you remember, as long as you believe, you can do it, I understand, as long as you choose to believe, nothing is impossible. But sometimes it is our faith, it is too easy to be broken, I believe it is not much use, need a lot of time and money, you remember, you do a thing, you choose, do not believe, who can choose to give you the money? Well, if you, as a leader, first of all, you have to be able to keep up with your own efforts. Do you know that you can't keep up with your own efforts? no, you will be knocked down by a few things, and you will meet a few investors. If people are not optimistic about your project, you will be done. After meeting a few friends, you will lose your confidence. Then your mental strength is not enough to support an enterprise, and you are not enough to be a good leader. Nothing can be done. The only thing that can really break you is yourself.\nfifty-seven\nThe advice to everyone is that when the next dividend comes, what is the next dividend? I think in the next five to ten years, all unilateral transactions on the second generation Internet will transition from unilateral transactions to multilateral transactions, the basis of unilateral transactions to multilateral transactions will be visit decentralization, and unilateral non-centralization will be completely decentralized. Then what does this decentralization provide? In the past, employees, er, received goods and entered the company, so in the next five to ten years, the value that employees, ah, individuals can provide comes from random or from a combination of more yuan, this combination will be unilateral transactions or peripheral transactions, so I think the next time may be to reflect their own value, or what they can really do well. Then, what you have done well makes it something that can be needed by others, that is, you do not serve much unilaterally, so serve multilaterally. I think the service serves well, ah. Each individual does not serve well to become a node. I think it is important to become a super node on this network. Everyone is not in a fixed position, but forms multilateral transactions in many positions.\nfifty-eight\nYou remember that today's post-zero, or even post-05th, post-10o, including a small number of post-90s, they must be people who can catch this hint of dividend. For sure, we no longer need businessmen in the future, because the essence of a businessman's money is that he has a source of goods, but now the information is becoming more and more transparent, and your source of goods is what the price is. Businessmen and businessmen just know that they make the source of goods. Pour one hand from the middle, and then make a price difference, but as the information becomes more and more transparent and the price becomes more and more average, there will no longer be so many businessmen in this market in the future, most of them are self-media. what is the business of buying and selling in this room? in the future market, he does not have the ability to become a new wave of rich. what is the new wave of people? The new wave of rich people should be young people who create value and unique value, they are the next wave, so the future value should return to the individual, the individual is the advent of the era of personal enterprise, or the advent of the visualization era of personal information nodes, this is the next trend of creating wealth, the next trend of creating wealth, rather than you buying and selling in the middle, this thing does not produce any value. It doesn't seem so easy to create. You remember today's zero. Later, or even after 2005, the post-10s group of people, including a small number of post-90s, they must be able to grasp this dividend, certainly not creative, you will not be able to survive in the future. You say that it is not easy to create because you have not received such education. When you come out of school, the finished product is processed in the factory, or if you go to work, you are also a finished product. You have not received what kind of education. What is creative education? what is open education? admit your own value. You do not have creativity, and you will not survive in the future. And now there are so many creative tools, such as gpt, then lunar, and then WEB3, third-generation Internet, these things are all better for you, so we do such a thing. Therefore, the class of businessmen will slowly decline. If you only sell homogenized products, we will not have such people to let you make a price difference in the middle in the future. They will sell this thing and turn it into a minimum basic guarantee. What is left is the innovation of the market, because you do not produce any value for this thing. You produce 10,000 pieces of clothing. Is there anything special about it? This thing has become some kind of living material, it is no longer. But commodities are daily necessities, our recent exports are so weak, and our foreign trade is so weak, because why do all countries pull their own industrial chains back to their own countries? Dear gpt, what if the designer is killed sooner or later? Dear gpt will not kill designers, no, because man is a species that can never live without meaning. You remember what dear gpt created, at most, it resonates with this marginal value network of human beings, and we will have a transition period, which is completely based on human creation and design, human and artificial intelligence together, and then to full artificial intelligence design. But it is impossible for us to accelerate this speed to that fast, because if this happens, people will lose their jobs. Once people lose their jobs, who will buy goods? So it won't be so fast, you don't have to worry about it, but what you need to do is the first thing you have to do is, since it's like this, you have to make yourself creative or become a sentencing personality. In this era when people are combined with artificial intelligence, or. Before the combination of human and artificial intelligence is coming, you need to know where the big development direction is, not homogenized commodities, but regionalized commodities. They are the first beneficiaries of the next trend of creating wealth. To put it bluntly, it is still a problem of human nodes. Robots can only provide you with some services. Simple copying will be replaced, which brings us a great challenge. Why do I say this challenge is particularly great? We used to be plagiarism, plagiarism has become popular in such an era, but now you understand that plagiarism is not fundamental, creation is fundamental.\nfifty-nine\nIf there is any opportunity now, you can try to clear the inventory industry, because we now have too much inventory, we are in a"}{"message": true, "content": "At the end of the period when a lot of inventory is needed, because now every large factory has a lot of inventory to eliminate, so going to inventory is the tail of this era. I think it is the tail of this era, ah, it is the tail of this era. If you come up with a set of ways to get rid of inventory, you can help those people empty their inventory. I think the next era is web3."}{"message": false, "content": "[TencentCloudSDKException] code:UnsupportedOperation.TextTooLong message:Please ensure that a single request length less than 6000 requestId:9ae4b842-b96d-408c-aa84-c41a053a6daf"}{"message": true, "content": "Or if you are short of money or something, you can talk to the company directly. If you follow this mode, you can also follow this model. If you understand this, then there is nothing to say. Later, you do it, and then everyone runs away, right? one is that you need to cultivate a new position that can take his place. This is the most important thing, that is, you don't have to worry about people running, understand? Understand that your company can break anything, talent can not break, even if make up, yes, even if there is, the reserve army has to make up.\nsixty-six\nEmployees, their kind of gossip, what do you think, you can't be fired? if there is one, you can't be fired directly, so it won't happen later. I asked you to do something, not to leave a message. I'm not raising a white rabbit. If this is really my fault, please convince me with logic instead of saying behind my back that I can show you no mercy. Just talk about the sun, should you fucking do this? Can you point directly at my head and nose? You can accept it, you can listen, don't think of people as having a central system, how smart a CEO can solve such a thing. People should not be overly aware of themselves and understand that all problems need to be solved together. It does not mean that one person makes decisions. If, like this class, you are left to make decisions alone, there may be big problems, because a person's cognitive ability is limited, but the premise is that your people must be United. As a leader, should you be decisive? As a leader, all my decisions are made after my rational analysis of this matter. You think this is good for you, not my will, not good for you, sorry, this is not my will, I only stand in this point of view to analyze and think about the problem. I just... Right and wrong, instead of standing right and wrong, but I only stand on whether it should be or not. This is not the right thing for people, because we all get together to do it together, not because of feelings, but because of things. To be clear, if this thing goes wrong and does not succeed, the premise is that after I have made a rational and logical analysis and judgment on the matter, I think it must and must be done. Then, if this matter is wrong and does not succeed, it is my fault. I am the decision-maker. I am the judge. The mistake is that I am the mistake of my decision-making, and not everything I understand requires personal responsibility. Also need to make decisions for this person to bear, to bear their own efforts, their own judgment of the consequences.\nsixty-seven\nWhat do you think of the trough period with a company? if there is a very low period in the middle, how should you spend this day? the trough is part of my plan, ah, yes, it is also part of my plan, but it may be really a little difficult. I think it is like this during the valley period, that is, every small company will have a fifth phase, and the valley period is a necessary process. And or once, and not more than once, that is to say, as a founder, your spirit, your spiritual strength is particularly strong at this time, and then, for example, if you have investors, how do you convince investors, that is, to tell him, that is to say, you should have the ability to make a profit? this is important, although you want to have the ability to make a profit, but you choose. Not profitable, no, this is another thing, that is, you have the ability to make a profit, you do not make a profit, but go fishing for a long time, that is, you have to think about this thing in the early stage, these models are very important, that is to say, if I want to serve users, then I have to do something, and then I can accumulate the number of my users for a long time, or after the number of users reaches that place, and then I choose to make a profit. Can you bear it, that is, I know that I can make a profit, but I can't make a profit, but you can't make a profit. If you don't make a profit, you can't, just keep it from loss, right, keep it from loss, otherwise, like this, like this kind of long-term doctrine, you may specially endure your own state of mind, that is, what is your strategic law at the beginning, and what is your certainty? Whether your vision is accurate or sharp enough, you have to make the right layout first, and then how do you tell your employees whether they can follow you with one heart? are you willing to accompany you to lose money or even make a profit? or as CEO, I can not get paid. I set goals for myself, that is, to let people see that I am not paid, what stage I have reached, and then I will start to get the job again. If I start asking for a salary again, I will set a benchmark for the employees so that they can settle down first. It should be that I can first do a good job of that benchmark, and then legislate for myself to understand.\nsixty-eight\nEverything thinks of their own interests, put their own first in everything, oh, to pull others to set off their own, I do not think this is a delicate egoist, this is not enough, this is only superficial, where is the real wealth hidden? The real wealth lies in your delicacy to yourself. Egoists achieve the extreme, that is compassion, the real wealth is hidden in the true compassion, that is to exquisite egoism to the extreme. Mercy, this is the greatest fucking wealth, he can not only bring you spiritual wealth, but also bring you material wealth. Those egoists, those exquisite egoists, he can only earn a little money, but he will never be stable in his life. While I want to satisfy myself, my market is big enough, I want everyone to be inseparable from me, and I am the last one to earn money. I am not hanging 1 million, 1 million meters from everyone. I hang a dollar from each person. I serve others, and others cannot leave me. Some is for nothing, nothing is for you, and you have to kill yourself. But in the eyes of people like me, when you only think about the immediate interests and do not see the further value, it is as if you are not ready to win, but you are ready for defeat. Many people's conditions do not allow them to see far away, you mean. Many people's conditions are not enough for them to see far away, but in my opinion, this is not the case. Gautama saw the whole cosmo universe under a banyan tree. Do you think it's their vision? No, I think there is nothing in a glass of water. Why is it that Gautama weighs 84000 in a glass of water? I think a beautiful woman is a demon. He thinks a beautiful woman is not a demon. The question is whether other people's beauties are demons. What does it have to do with other people's beauties? What we say is that I am the source of all the problems. What does it have to do with other people's beauties is my problem. I think whether this thing can be done or not has nothing to do with it. I can't keep up with my ability, ambition or whatever. What does that have to do with it? What does it have to do with your ability? It has nothing to do with your heart. What are you asking all the time? who are you? What I've been emphasizing is who you are and where all our pain comes from.\nsixty-nine\nYou remember, ah, once a person enters a particular field, it is bound to have a cognitive barrier. It should be noted that sometimes people have a thinking blind spot, that is, when you enter a room, you see the chimney, you see the window, you see the skylight, and then you see, the people in this room, I say 123, go out. You see that these people are not climbing up the chimney. It is from the window that you climb up, and your limbs form a barrier, a barrier. That is, we all climb out of the window and through the chimney, but we ignore that as long as you look back, the door is there, right, then we all look at it, from the window, ah, from the chimney, but don't look back, right. Do you think that the more you think, the harder it will be to eat yourself into fat first, and then starve yourself back to healthy skinny people? I eliminated a lot of information that I didn't need. When we eat fat, we definitely have to ingest all kinds of knowledge and all kinds of things, and then after we really understand these things, we try to turn ourselves into thin words, lean words, just like what you said just now. Can make a profit, but I can choose not to make a profit, I have the ability to make a profit, but choose not to make a profit, you are the same reason, right? Yes, I understand. Thank you, Sun, OK. Have a nice trip.\nseventy\nIt is not important for this person to ask for money, if he is greedy, he will not revolt, that is, if he is greedy, it may be a good thing, right? the more greedy he is, the less likely he will revolt, because the idea that he may make money may be bigger than yours, um, I will make this company more profitable. If a person is particularly capable, then he will feel that no matter what I do, he has a special say, and then come to build air power, how to deal with this situation? Well, since you want to empty me, you can empty me, ah, I can push it down, because I am doing it for this company, not for me, ah, and even say that I can directly give up my position to you. If I can, I will not give way. If he can lead this company better, why not do it? Well, I can even say, I'll get out and do something else, right, but if I just want money, I can, ah, I will give you, ah, if you can bring me far more benefits than the public capital you want, ah, ah, you can completely understand it to him according to the conditions he has proposed. I feel that this is the pattern, the ultimate goal of this company is to grow, but if a CEO does not force himself, it must be that the seniority of the young people in the future will be higher, he will certainly be smarter than you, and the generation will be better than the other. Yes, many of us just insist on holding on to this company. As for you, your vision has always been in it. Yes, I see. Anyway, don't forget your original mind, because when you first started doing it, you didn't do it for yourself, but when you did it, you are not your own. You are the company's. Right, the better the company is, the better you are. I always know that I am doing something, this is far more important than me, understand, from that moment, you are not an individual, you can not represent an individual, right? Yes, his whole person is composed of this company. in fact, it is a life, that is, a grasshopper on a rope. it is not a grasshopper on a rope, but the whole group adds up to a life. as you just said, it is fully integrated with Jobs and Apple. Yes, some people always want to control and take the company in what direction. I think this company is designed by us, no, it is growing, self-growing, it is also alive, will grow, will grow. AK has a book called out of Control, you can read it, this may be helpful to you. Kevin Kelly's out of control, according to Kevin Kelly in this book, the companies of the future will be life-oriented organizations, which will be much larger than mechanical organizations, because life-oriented organizations are more bottom-up than top-down. Bottom-up can be produced. A variety of exploration, it can bring you like an octopus, cut off your leg, you can also have other muscles, and even cut off that one, it can grow back. Yes, the hundred-legged bug is dead but not stiff. Today's Traffic's Jinri Toutiao Douyin mantis shrimp connotation joke Dong Cedi, and then the volcano small watermelon, watermelon small video, you see, all inside is like an APP factory, and all their products have one gene, the dragon gives birth to nine sons, all are the children of the dragon, but the nine sons are different, but they also have common genes, and they are all to do one thing. Yes, that is, the various ways of division that you have just mentioned. It is a typing biotype, just like an apple tree. If you rip off an apple, it will not affect the growth of the apple tree. Yes, the eggs will not be put on the same version. Zhang Yiming is very clever, ah, he said that he said, your understanding of a thing. It is very important that we should not just look at the present and then adhere to long-term doctrine, right.\n\n"}
